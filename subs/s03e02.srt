535
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:57,333
of a receipt for a computer
that I bought there.

536
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,566
It was 1987.

537
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:03,633
I remember I talked to a guy

538
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,333
had like a maroon sport jacket,

539
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:09,000
and he might've had a toupee.

540
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:10,166
Oh, it was a weave.

541
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,800
Okay, uh...

542
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,700
Well, then, I'll come by.

543
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:15,866
Okay, bye.

544
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,866
Anybody want to take
a walk down to 48th street?

545
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,500
I think I may have
tracked down another receipt.

546
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:24,833
I can't. I gotta go visit Tina
in the hospital.

547
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:27,033
George?
I'm going to a poetry reading

548
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:28,666
with Patrice.

549
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,800
First-time poets.

550
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:34,033
It's in a burnt-out building
down by the docks.

551
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,000
It's supposed to be good.

552
00:20:38,566 --> 00:20:39,015
Hey.

553
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:40,200
Hey.

554
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:41,866
Are you going
to the hospital now?

555
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,366
Yeah,
I suppose I am.

556
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,633
All right, great, great.

557
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,966
Uh, we'll share a cab.

558
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,333
Oh, you're going by 48th street.
You can give me a ride.

559
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:49,366
I'm getting in on that.

560
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,366
Yeah.

561
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,466
You know
you're chipping in.

562
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,633
You're going
that way anyway!

563
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:54,733
Aw, come on!

564
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,500
I was audited last year.
I have been through an audit.

565
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:02,800
At first I thought, "Well, IRS,
kind of sounds like Toys 'R' Us.

566
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,633
"Maybe it won't be so bad.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

567
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,800
Maybe they have a sense of fun
about it, you know?"

568
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,015
But it's-- It's bad.
It's an ordeal...

569
00:21:09,015 --> 00:21:09,133
But it's-- It's bad.
It's an ordeal...

570
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,866
and they don't do anything
to keep your spirits up

571
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,866
through the ordeal.

572
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,966
I think they should take
all your receipts

573
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,166
and put them in one of those
big Lucite sweepstake drums

574
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,366
and just kind of
crank it around there.

575
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,533
You know, give you a feeling
like you might win something.

576
00:21:23,566 --> 00:21:24,800
You know what I mean?

577
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,000
Then they can pull them out
one by one and go,

578
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:30,800
"Oh, I'm sorry. That's another
illegal deduction,

579
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:34,200
"but we do have some lovely
parting gifts for you...

580
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:36,033
Jail."

581
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:39,000

582
