He's good.

Chadway's. What's going on?

527
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:05,823
We're having the intervention.
We're waiting for Richie.

528
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:07,525
Oh, right, right.
The intervention.

529
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:08,526
Um...

530
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,160
Should we leave?

531
00:19:10,193 --> 00:19:12,529
Well, uh, I--
Elaine, hi.

532
00:19:12,562 --> 00:19:13,184
Hi, Noel.

533
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:14,264
Hi, Noel.

534
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:16,266
Well, you're
looking well.

535
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,234
Jerry, let me
tell you something.

536
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:21,938
A man without hand
is not a man.

537
00:19:21,971 --> 00:19:25,207
I've got so much hand,
I'm coming out my gloves.

538
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:26,608
I got to thank Kramer.

539
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:28,944
Even if I were dragged
through manure...

540
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:30,611
I still wouldn't put
that stuff on.

541
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:34,082
This man is a genius!
A genius!

542
00:19:34,115 --> 00:19:36,417
You think so?
No, I don't think so, I know so.

543
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:38,052
Come here. I gotta talk to you.
What?

544
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:41,121
The male kangaroo
doesn't have a pouch.

545
00:19:41,155 --> 00:19:43,184
Only the female
has it,

546
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:43,523
Only the female
has it,

547
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,592
so the male
has pouch envy!

548
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,993
[CHUCKLES]

549
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:50,897
"Why should she have
this huge pouch,

550
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,731
"and I have nothing?

551
00:19:52,765 --> 00:19:55,634
"I have things
to carry too.

552
00:19:57,335 --> 00:19:59,905
At least-- At least
give me a pocket."

[COUGHS]

557
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,085
That laugh.

558
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:16,720
That's the laugh.

559
00:20:16,753 --> 00:20:18,088
That's it!

560
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:19,422
You're the one!

561
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:21,091
No, no.
No, it was an accident.

562
00:20:21,124 --> 00:20:22,792
It w-wasn't my fault!

563
00:20:22,825 --> 00:20:23,926
It was Jerry!

564
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:26,796
Jerry put a PEZ dispenser
on my leg!

565
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:30,899
You put a PEZ dispenser
on her leg during my recital?

566
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:32,401
I didn't know
she would laugh.

567
00:20:32,434 --> 00:20:33,602
And, you.

568
00:20:33,635 --> 00:20:36,604
You lied to me, George.
You lied to me!

569
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:37,638
N-n-no, no.
I-I-I d-d-didn't.

570
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,773
W-w-w-what--?
What did I do?

571
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:42,676
What--? Where are
you going?

572
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:44,978
I...

573
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:46,079
am breaking up...

574
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:48,915
with you.
Whoa, whoa, wait.

575
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,683
You can't break up
with me.

576
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:52,418
I-I've got hand!

577
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:55,121
And you're gonna
need it.

578
00:20:57,989 --> 00:21:00,559
Noel. Noel!

579
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,729
Hey, Richie!
Hey, Richie.

580
00:21:05,463 --> 00:21:06,697
So, what's going on?

581
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:09,467
JERRY:
So we start the intervention,

582
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,036
and it's pretty ugly
from the get-go.

583
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:13,184
He's not listening,

584
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:13,203
He's not listening,

585
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:14,204
he's hostile,

586
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:15,539
he's talking back.

587
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:18,174
I can't do these puzzles.

588
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,143
So he starts to get up.

589
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:21,444
Suddenly...

590
00:21:21,477 --> 00:21:24,013
he spots the PEZ dispenser
on the coffee table.

591
00:21:24,047 --> 00:21:26,649
[CHUCKLES]
The PEZ dispenser.

592
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:28,016
He picks it up,

593
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,385
he's staring at it.

594
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:31,553
It's like
he's hypnotized by it.

595
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:34,522
Then he's telling us this story
about how when he was a kid,

596
00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:36,391
he was in the car
with his father

597
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:38,793
and his father was trying
to load one of them.

598
00:21:38,826 --> 00:21:39,861
Well, they're
hard to load.

599
00:21:39,894 --> 00:21:41,528
Tell me something
I don't know.

600
00:21:44,031 --> 00:21:46,200
So as the father's
trying to load it,

601
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:48,201
he loses control
of the car,

602
00:21:48,234 --> 00:21:50,403
crashes into
a high school cafeteria.

603
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:52,172
Get out.
Nobody's hurt,

604
00:21:52,205 --> 00:21:54,874
but PEZ was all over
the car.

605
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:56,842
And the dispenser
was destroyed

606
00:21:56,876 --> 00:21:59,178
virtually
beyond recognition.

607
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,015
Poor kid.
So as he's telling the story,

608
00:22:03,048 --> 00:22:04,216
he starts crying.

609
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:06,084
Well, what did you do?
What do you think?

610
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,886
I gave him
my PEZ dispenser.

611
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,087
Wow.

612
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,223
Two hours later,
he checks into Smither's clinic.

613
00:22:12,256 --> 00:22:13,184
Talked to the doctor yesterday.
He's doing great on the rehab,

614
00:22:13,184 --> 00:22:15,493
Talked to the doctor yesterday.
He's doing great on the rehab,

615
00:22:15,526 --> 00:22:16,694
he's hooked on PEZ.

616
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:23,065
He's eating them
like there's no tomorrow.

617
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:25,234
What's a three-letter word
for candy?

618
00:22:27,536 --> 00:22:29,771
I can't do those things.

619
00:22:41,749 --> 00:22:45,520
Jawbreakers, to me, was like
the ultimate challenge candy.

620
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:46,921
It was almost like
candy manufacturers

621
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:49,223
were sitting
in their laboratories, going,

622
00:22:49,256 --> 00:22:50,457
"I wonder if they'll eat this.

623
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,591
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

624
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,060
"This seems pretty tough to eat.

625
00:22:54,093 --> 00:22:56,730
"Let's market it as
some sort of an experiment."

626
00:22:56,763 --> 00:22:58,197
But the concept of Jawbreakers,

627
00:22:58,231 --> 00:22:59,465
what was the concept?

628
00:22:59,498 --> 00:23:02,401
Multicolored cement balls
for a quarter?

629
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:04,069
Was that the idea behind it?

630
00:23:04,102 --> 00:23:06,939
"Let's see if we can hurt them.

631
00:23:06,972 --> 00:23:08,440
"Let's see if they'll pay...

632
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:09,874
to be hurt."

633
00:23:09,907 --> 00:23:10,401
This is the idea
behind Jawbreakers.

634
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:11,743
This is the idea
behind Jawbreakers.

635
00:23:11,776 --> 00:23:13,745
And I did it, I ate them,
I loved them.

636
00:23:13,778 --> 00:23:14,746
Ow. Ow. Ow.

637
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:15,880
Ow. Ow. Ow.

638
00:23:15,913 --> 00:23:17,381
Oh, this is very painful.

639
00:23:17,414 --> 00:23:18,549
I'm really hurting.

640
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:19,985
And this is hurting me a lot.

641
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:21,552
I love them.
