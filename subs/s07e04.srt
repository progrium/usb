<i>charged to Martinez.</i>

532
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,191
<i>with a throwing error</i>
<i>charged to Martinez.</i>

533
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:13,591
Hey.

534
00:19:13,624 --> 00:19:15,258
That's not a home run.

535
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,724
Well, maybe not technically,
but--

536
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:19,224
You said he could hit
two home runs.

537
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,758
Come on, Bobby.
Bobby, that's just as good!

538
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,391
You're not taking that card!

539
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:25,058
Bobby, we had a deal.

540
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:26,224
Come on, give me that.

541
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:29,124
So...

542
00:19:29,158 --> 00:19:30,391
is the chop the way you like it?

543
00:19:30,424 --> 00:19:32,758
I usually like mine
with an angioplasty.

544
00:19:41,091 --> 00:19:45,424
Something really stinks
to high-- Holly.

545
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,858
What are you doing here?

546
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:47,891
What everyone does here:

547
00:19:47,924 --> 00:19:49,058
Cooking pork chops.

548
00:19:49,091 --> 00:19:50,058
Listen, I'm--

549
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:52,191
I'm meeting James here.

550
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,724
He's bringing over your jacket.

551
00:19:53,758 --> 00:19:55,724
What about the napkins?

552
00:19:55,758 --> 00:19:58,091
Oh, God.
I didn't take your napkins.

553
00:19:58,124 --> 00:19:59,224
Then who did?

554
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:00,891
Ask Jerry.

555
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:03,058
We could argue all night
over who took the napkins,

556
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:06,958
but in today's modern world,
it just doesn't seem relevant.

557
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:09,414
I still want to know what
happened to that birthday card.

558
00:20:09,414 --> 00:20:10,724
I still want to know what
happened to that birthday card.

559
00:20:10,758 --> 00:20:12,524
Morgan, did you ever sign it?

560
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:14,391
No, sir,
George never gave it to me.

561
00:20:14,424 --> 00:20:15,758
That's right, I didn't.

562
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,691
I take full responsibility
for the card not being here. I--

563
00:20:18,724 --> 00:20:19,691
Hey, I got it.

564
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:21,358
What's this?

565
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:22,958
Oh, it's a birthday card.

566
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,124
George, by the way,
tomorrow night,

567
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:29,658
Paul O'Neill has to catch
a fly ball in his hat.

568
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:33,891
George, this is beautiful!

569
00:20:33,924 --> 00:20:35,024
Why didn't you tell me

570
00:20:35,058 --> 00:20:36,791
you were gonna have it
mounted like this?

571
00:20:36,824 --> 00:20:39,391
You were probably just
gonna stick it in an envelope.

572
00:20:39,424 --> 00:20:40,558
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

573
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:42,458
[LAUGHING]

574
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,191
George, keep up the good work.

575
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:46,958
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

576
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:50,258
Well, you screwed me again,
Costanza.

577
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,924
How am I supposed
to sign the card now?

578
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,324
It's already under glass.

579
00:20:56,491 --> 00:20:57,724
Hi, James.

580
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:58,791
Oh, this is, um, Holly--

581
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,391
Excuse me.
What are those dogs wearing?

582
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:02,691
Oh, bandannas.

583
00:21:02,724 --> 00:21:03,958
Aren't they cute?

584
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:07,224
You gave Mema's napkins
to some dogs?

585
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:08,458
What happened to my jacket?

586
00:21:08,491 --> 00:21:09,414
The dogs did that,
but it wasn't their fault.

587
00:21:09,414 --> 00:21:10,891
The dogs did that,
but it wasn't their fault.

588
00:21:10,924 --> 00:21:13,358
Somebody stuffed some
strange meat in the pockets.

589
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:14,624
Was it mutton?

590
00:21:14,658 --> 00:21:16,858
Could have been.

591
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:18,891
You always stuff meat
in your pockets?

592
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:20,458
Uh...

593
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:21,991
sometimes I use the sofa.

594
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,758
You wanted to see me?

595
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,891
Yes, George, please, come in.
Thanks for the card.

596
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,258
I loved it.
It made me feel good.

597
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,691
Word has it you were the brains
behind the whole thing.

598
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:38,858
Not just me.
The whole organization.

599
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:39,924
Especially Mr. Morgan.

600
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,058
Morgan.
Morgan.

601
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,758
His name is conspicuously absent
from this card.

602
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,458
Like he went out of his way
not to sign it.

603
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:46,891
No, Morgan is a good man, sir.

604
00:21:46,924 --> 00:21:47,958
Stop kowtowing to Morgan.

605
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:49,624
Congratulations.
You've got his job.

606
00:21:49,658 --> 00:21:51,791
Well, thank you, sir.

607
00:21:51,824 --> 00:21:53,391
I'm not quite sure
I'm right for it.

608
00:21:53,424 --> 00:21:55,091
It's done, George.
He's out, you're in.

609
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:55,743
A lot more work, you know.
I know.

610
00:21:55,743 --> 00:21:56,558
A lot more work, you know.
I know.

611
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:58,291
A lot more responsibility.
I know.

612
00:21:58,324 --> 00:22:00,191
Long, long hours.
I know.

613
00:22:00,224 --> 00:22:01,924
Not much more money.

614
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,424
But you'll finally get
the recognition you deserve.

615
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,424
That's what I'm afraid of.

616
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,924
Mr. Steinbrenner, if I--

617
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,891
Painful as it is,
I've had to let a few people go

618
00:22:09,924 --> 00:22:11,091
over the years.

619
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:16,891
Yogi Berra, Lou Piniella,
Bucky Dent, Billy Martin,

620
00:22:16,924 --> 00:22:21,958
Dallas Green, Dick Hauser,
Bill Virdon, Billy Martin,

621
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:25,743
Stump Merrill, Billy Martin,
Bob Lemon, Billy Martin,

622
00:22:25,743 --> 00:22:27,091
Stump Merrill, Billy Martin,
Bob Lemon, Billy Martin,

623
00:22:27,124 --> 00:22:30,191
Gene Michael, Buck Showalter--
Uh, George!

624
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:31,391
You didn't hear that from me.

625
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,791
George?
