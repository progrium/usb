All right, Jerry.
I'll do it.

363
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:16,733
See ya.

364
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,800
So, I ran into
the Rosses again.

365
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,466
Oh, right,
at the coffee shop.

366
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,324
Where did they get the idea
that you have a place

367
00:13:25,324 --> 00:13:25,533
Where did they get the idea
that you have a place

368
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,166

369
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:31,866
From me.

370
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,000
What did you say?

371
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:36,566
I told them I have a place
in the Hamptons.

372
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,733
What did <i>you</i> say?

373
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:39,366
I told them you didn't.

374
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,866
And I laughed,
and I laughed.

go on and on,

381
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,733
They never said a thing!

You don't let somebody lie

383
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:55,866
You don't let somebody lie

384
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,066

385
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,166
You call them a liar!

386
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,233
Like you're a liar!

387
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:01,400
Yes, thank you!
Was that so hard?

388
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:04,333
So this is over?
Not over?

389
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:05,866
I'm bettin'...not over.

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,200
Not by a long shot.

I'm callin' up the Rosses
and inviting them out

392

Then we'll see
who blinks first!

394
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:17,733
Haven't you done enough
to these people?

395
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,833
This is not about them.

I'm black. Oh, you know what?

Yes, it's awful!

They're upset because
we're an interracial couple?

542
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,078
So what are you?

543
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,212
I'm white.

544
00:19:58,245 --> 00:19:59,118
So we're just a...

545
00:19:59,118 --> 00:20:00,445
So we're just a...

546
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:01,845
couple of white people?

547
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:04,878
I guess.

548
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,778
Oh.

549
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:09,612
Yeah.

550
00:20:09,645 --> 00:20:10,912
So do you want to go
to the Gap?

551
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:11,845
Sure.

552
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:16,212
[♪]

553
00:20:16,245 --> 00:20:18,212
Oh, well.

554
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:19,912
I handed out
all the Wizards.

555
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:21,245
The polls close
in one hour.

556
00:20:21,278 --> 00:20:22,412
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

557
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:25,245
I think we got this baby
all sewn up, huh?

558
00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:27,112
Yeah. Oh, uh--

559
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:29,118
There was an extra one.
Norman Bergerman.

560
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:30,212
There was an extra one.
Norman Bergerman.

561
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:33,212
He won't be leavin'
any tips where he is. Aw.

562
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:34,978
Congratulations,
Mr. President.

563
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:37,478
Congratulations,
Mr. Puppet Master.

564
00:20:37,512 --> 00:20:39,478
Ha-ha.
Hey, Morty.

565
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:41,545
What's wrong with these
tip calculators?

566
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:42,978
What are you
talking about?

567
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:43,978
It's overtipping.

568
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:46,445
I just left 5 bucks
for a BLT.

569
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:47,412
Let me see that.

570
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:51,045
This isn't a Wizard,
it's a Willard.

571
00:20:51,078 --> 00:20:53,078
A Willard?

572
00:20:53,112 --> 00:20:55,212
Sacamano Sr. screwed me!

573
00:20:55,245 --> 00:20:56,978
Mine doesn't have a seven.

574
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:58,245
I'm ruined!

575
00:20:58,278 --> 00:20:59,118
Jerry,
why didn't you get them Wizards?

576
00:20:59,118 --> 00:21:00,478
Jerry,
why didn't you get them Wizards?

577
00:21:00,512 --> 00:21:02,545
Because
a real Wizard's $200!

578
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:03,712
You didn't have a deal?

579
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:05,778
No deal, not hot.

580
00:21:05,812 --> 00:21:08,645
Morty, you and Kramer,
you're finished.

581
00:21:08,678 --> 00:21:10,078
What?

582
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:13,145
SID:
Everyone vote for the guy in the wheelchair.

583
00:21:13,178 --> 00:21:16,278
The people have spoken.

584
00:21:16,312 --> 00:21:19,012
Well, that's it for me. I'm--
I'm headin' back to New York.

585
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:23,712
Dad, I'm sorry.

586
00:21:23,745 --> 00:21:24,978
You should be!

587
00:21:25,012 --> 00:21:28,712
How could you spend $200
on a tip calculator?!

588
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,118
It does other things!

589
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:31,312
It does other things!

590
00:21:31,345 --> 00:21:34,312
[♪]

591
00:21:37,845 --> 00:21:40,812
[♪]

592
00:21:44,078 --> 00:21:46,212
Where are we, George?

593
00:21:46,245 --> 00:21:47,878
Almost there.

594
00:21:47,912 --> 00:21:50,578
This is the end
of Long Island.

595
00:21:50,612 --> 00:21:52,812
Where's your house?

596
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:56,212
We, uh, go on foot from here.

597
00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:57,145
All right.

598
00:22:09,145 --> 00:22:11,545
There's no house!

599
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:12,912
It's a lie!

600
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:15,812
There's no solarium.
There's no Prickly Pete.

601
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:17,945
There's no other solarium.

602
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:19,345
We know.

603
00:22:21,912 --> 00:22:23,445
Then why?

604
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:24,945
Why did you make me

605
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:27,378
drive all the way out here?!

606
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,212
Why didn't you say something?

607
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:31,945
Why? Why? Why?!

608
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:35,478
We don't like you, George.

609
00:22:37,245 --> 00:22:40,478
And we always blamed you
for what happened to Susan.

610
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:45,745
Oh.

611
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:47,478
All right.

612
00:22:47,512 --> 00:22:50,245
Let's head back.

613
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:52,945
