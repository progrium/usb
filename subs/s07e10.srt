1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,566
Gum is one of
the weirdest human inventions.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,966
It's not a liquid. It's not
a solid. It's not a food.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,033
What is it?
It isn't really anything.

4
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:14,500
You know, I mean, it's like
a stationary bike for your jaw.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,000
Remember when you were in
school,

6
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:18,633
and teachers would get
all riled up

7
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,000
if they caught you with gum?

8
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:22,166
When you're a kid, you think,
"What is the big deal?"

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,633
But as an adult,
I can understand it

10
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:24,966
because when you're chewing gum

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,200
you don't look like you're

12
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:28,466
too thrilled with anything
anybody has to say.

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,000
"Oh, World War II, that was
an important historical event?

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,133
"Oh, World War II, that was
an important historical event?

15
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,600
"Yeah, I'm sure.

16
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,066
"They landed a man
on the moon in 1969?

17
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,833
"Yeah, right.

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,233
Yeah, I buy that, teach."

19
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,066
Do you think she's happy?

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,133
Who?

21
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,500
The cashier.

22
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:57,700
Ruthie Cohen?

23
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:59,033
You know her name?

24
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:00,300
Sure.

25
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,866
I don't think I've ever
spoken to her.

26
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,533
Maybe that's why
she's happy.

27
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:07,300
Good morning, gentlemen.

28
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,733
What is this?

29
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:13,200
Well, it's the latest offering
from the Alex Theater.

30
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:15,900
That stinky
old movie house?

31
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:16,630
Yeah, you should smell it now.

32
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,700
Yeah, you should smell it now.

33
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:19,233
We fixed up the place.

34
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:20,566
What? <i>Spartacus?</i>

35
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,433
Well, it's
a rare archival print.

36
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:29,066
Twelve extra minutes,
full wide-screen CinemaScope.

37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,466
And if you come
to the 1:00 show,

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,666
you can hear Jeffrey Haarwood.

39
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,666
Jeffrey who?

40
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,300
Haarwood.

41
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,400
He was the assistant
wardrobe man on <i>Spartacus.</i>

42
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,233
He has some fascinating
insights into the production.

43
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:46,133
Why would I spend $7 to see
a movie that I can watch on TV?

44
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:46,630
Well, why go to
a fine restaurant

45
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,866
Well, why go to
a fine restaurant

46
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,400
when you can just stick
somethin' in the microwave?

47
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:52,800
Why go to the park
and fly a kite

48
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:56,400
when you can just
pop a pill?

49
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:58,633
Listen, you guys haven't seen
Lloyd Braun, have you?

50
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,700
I'm meeting him here.

51
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:01,366
Lloyd? What do you
have to meet him for?

52
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,166
Well, he's using his connections
in the mayor's office

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,566
to get the theater
landmark status.

54
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,866
I thought he screwed up
the Dinkins campaign.

55
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,533
Well, he did. After that,
he had a nervous breakdown.

56
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,333
Had to spend a few months
in an institution.

57
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:16,630
Really?

58
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,900
Really?

59
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:18,733
Yeah, but he's doing
a lot better now.

60
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:19,966
I've taken him under my wing.

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,533
Oh, then I'm not worried.

62
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:23,700
But he still needs
all of our support.

63
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:24,866
You know, when he gets here,

64
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,533
treat him like he's
one of the gang, huh?

65
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:27,966
Breakdown, huh?

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,966
Hey, Kramer.

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,233
Oh, hey, Lloyd.
Hey, buddy.

68
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:32,033
How you doing?
Hi, Jerry. Lloyd.

69
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:33,033
George.

70
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:35,000
Hello, Lloyd.

71
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:36,466
How you doin'?

72
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,800
Well, he's doin' fine,
George.

73
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:39,833
Gum?

74
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:41,400
That's an interesting package.

75
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:43,200
Yeah, it's from China.

76
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:44,500
Go ahead, try a piece.

77
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:45,666
Tell me that's not

78
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,630
the most delicious
gum you've ever tasted.

79
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,733
the most delicious
gum you've ever tasted.

80
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:50,166
Yes, yes, we shall all
try a piece

81
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,866
and tell you
how delicious it is.

82
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,866
George?

83
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,833
I don't chew gum.

84
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:57,000
Mmm.
It's different.

85
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,200
Where'd you get it?

86
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:00,166
A friend of mine in Chinatown
gave it to me.

87
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,966
If you want, I can ask him
where he got it.

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,133
Nah, don't bother.

89
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,566
It's no problem.
I don't want it.

90
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,000
Jerry, Lloyd says
it's no problem.

91
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:10,866
He's capable
of locating the gum.

92
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,833
All right.

93
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:15,733
Boy, this is--
This is delicious. Mmm.

GEORGE:
You know what?

96
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:25,566
I think this Ruthie Cohen
gave me the wrong change.

97
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,900
Didn't I pay with a 20?
I'm sure I paid with a 20.

98
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:28,900
Hey.

99
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,300
I think I finally figured out

100
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,566
what the flavor is in this gum.

101
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,966
It's a little lo mein-y.

102
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What kind is that?

103
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,800
It's Chinese gum
Lloyd Braun gave me.

104
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,733
Lloyd Braun.
How's he doin'?

105
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,233
After Dinkins
lost the election,

106
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,133
he had a complete
nervous breakdown.

107
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,630
They had to lock him up.

108
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,133
They had to lock him up.

109
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,233
That's around the same time
I broke up with Lloyd.

110
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:50,566
You-- You don't think that I had

111
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,733
anything to do
with his breakdown, do you?

112
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,333
I remember when
we parted company,

113
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:56,400
I was babbling
incoherently for months.

114
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:57,866
Yeah, well, I got
news for you.

115
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,800
The whole time that
I was growing up,

116
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,400
all I ever heard
from my mother was:

117
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:04,133
"Why can't you be more
like that Lloyd Braun?"

118
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,866
In the end Lloyd
became more like you.

00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:08,566

Hey, Mr. Lazzari.

Back in
the old neighborhood, huh?

00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:26,566
Yeah, yeah, just delivering

did you hear about Lloyd Braun?

150
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,033
The Alex was built in 1922

151
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:05,033
during the golden age
of movie palaces.

152
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:12,000
Minor restorations
in 1941, '47, '52, '58, '63

153
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:16,166
and currently to our
present period of time.

154
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,630
You're really gettin'
into this. Yes, I am.

155
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,333
You're really gettin'
into this. Yes, I am.

156
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:19,566
The icing on that cake would be

157
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,233
getting that landmark status
from the city.

158
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:25,566
We're hoping Lloyd Braun
can pull a few strings.

159
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,833
Oh, can Lloyd
really do that?

160
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:29,500
Lloyd Braun can do anything
he puts his mind to.

161
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:30,833
He's fine, Jerry.

162
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:32,500

hello to him, Elaine.

00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:38,666
Lloyd, yes. Hello.

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,066
Did Kramer
tell you?

for getting us--

afterwards. Come on.

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,900

00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,566
Am I crazy,
or is that a lot of gum?

527
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,300
It's a lot of gum.

528
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,966
[♪]

529
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,233
KRAMER:
Mr. Haarwood, I found your glasses.

530
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:23,201
Oh, splendid, welcome
to the Institute

531
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:23,866
Oh, splendid, welcome
to the Institute

532
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,866
for the Preservation of Motion
Picture Costumes and Wardrobes.

533
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,433
Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W.

534
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:33,400
We prefer to call it
the Institute.

535
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:34,500
Is that from <i>Henry VIII?</i>

536
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,566
Yes, yes, it is.

537
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,366
Well, you know,
we're screening that

538
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,733
tonight at the Alex.

539
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:41,466
You think that I could wear
that to promote the theater?

540
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,866
Well, I'd love
to lend it to you,

541
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,733
but I doubt if it
would fit a man

542
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:48,533
of your impressive
Raymond Massey-like physique.

543
00:20:48,566 --> 00:20:51,900
The only person who could
really fit into this costume

544
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:53,201
would have to be
a short, stocky man

545
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:54,066
would have to be
a short, stocky man

546
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,533
of somewhat
generous proportion.

547
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:59,666
You don't say.

548
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,033
You're really helping
me out with this, buddy.

549
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:05,366
Kids are gonna
be so thrilled.

550
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,366
Yeah, yeah.

551
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,033
You really cashed in
on that favor pretty quick.

552
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:11,133
Remember, you are a king.

553
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,300
You must project
a royal bearing.

554
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,133
Oh, I'm going to give you
a royal bearing.

555
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,633
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

556
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,066
Let me get
a pack of gum.

557
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,201
Can I get
a pack of gum, please?

558
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:23,400
Can I get
a pack of gum, please?

559
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,566
I beg your pardon,
Your Majesty,

560
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,566
but we don't accept bills
with lipstick on the president.

561
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,900
What?

562
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:36,900
So I had it all along.
How do you like that?

563
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:39,900
[SNORTS]
I guess I owe that cashier an apology.

564
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:45,900
Oh, my God.

565
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:49,066
No, no, Deena, it's not
what you think.

566
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,200
This isn't mine.

567
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:51,833
I got it from
the Institute.

568
00:21:51,866 --> 00:21:53,201
The Institute.

569
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:54,066
The Institute.

570
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,666
Dee--! Deena!
Deena!

571
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
[♪]

572
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,625
Ah! Mr. Haarwood.

573
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:10,291
Well, you certainly know
how to dress for a premiere.

574
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:11,658
Well, thank you.

575
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:14,091
Where--? Where is your friend,
King Henry?

576
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,758
Oh, he ran away.

577
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,291
Hey, Kramer.

578
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:19,091
Let me talk to you.

579
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,925
You know, that button
looks very familiar.

580
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,191
Yes, it's-- It's antique ivory.

581
00:22:24,225 --> 00:22:25,758
I-I think that's my button.

582
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,591
You know, I've been
looking all over for it.

583
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:28,858
Did--? Did you find it here?

584
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:30,425
Yes, it was in
the lost and found.

585
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,425
Shall I undo it?

586
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,191
Of course.
Thank you.

587
00:22:33,225 --> 00:22:33,739
HARWOOD:
I'm a little ticklish.

588
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:35,358
HARWOOD:
I'm a little ticklish.

589
00:22:35,391 --> 00:22:37,658
[LAUGHS]
Tickle, tickle.

590
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:40,158
We really gotta get
that Elaine a boyfriend.

591
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:42,325
Oh, tell me about it.
