00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,166
I'll give you 25
if you let me do it.

179
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
What?

180
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:24,700
What is she
talking about?

181
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,666
What'd she say?
What did she say?

182
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,500
Will someone tell me
what she said?

183
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:29,833
What did she say?

184
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,800
What happened?

185
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,166
Did you see that?

186
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,333
What were you
telling them?

187
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:39,466
I offered them 25.
They had no idea why.

188
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,166
George, the phone's free.

189
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,366
Hallelujah.

190
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,300
Excuse me.
I-I was waiting here.

191
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,833
What, I didn't see you.

192
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:49,633
I've been standing here
for the last 10 minutes.

193
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:50,700
I've been standing here
for the last 10 minutes.

194
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:52,666
I won't be long.

195
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,866
Um, that's not
the point.

196
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,533
The point is I was here first.

197
00:07:56,566 --> 00:08:00,733
Well, if you were here first,
you'd be holding the phone.

198
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:11,666
You know, we're living
in a society!

199
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,533
We're supposed to act
in a civilized way!

200
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,666
Does she care?

201
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,966
No.

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,566
Does anyone ever display
the slightest sensitivity

203
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,666
over the problems
of a fellow individual?

204
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,966
No. No.

205
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,466
A resounding no.

206
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,733
Hey. Sorry
I took so long.

207
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:36,233
Oh, that's okay. Really,
don't worry about it.

208
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,700
How do people fast?

209
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:41,733
Did Gandhi
get this crazy?

210
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:43,200
I'm gonna go walk around

211
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:44,500
and see what dishes
look good.

212
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:46,500
I told my uncle I had
a stomachache tonight.

213
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:48,000
You think he bought that?

214
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,633
Yeah, he...

215
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:49,800
Yeah, he...

216
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,700
probably
bought it.

217
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:53,533
So, what happened
with Tatiana?

218
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,966
I shouldn't even tell you.

219
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,966
Come on.

220
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,066
Well, after dinner last week,

221
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,666
she invites me
back to her apartment.

222
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,500
I'm with you.

223
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:06,733
Well, it's this little place
with this little bathroom,

224
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:08,166
and it's, like, right there,
you know?

225
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,966
It's not even down a little hall
or off in an alcove,

226
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,366
you understand?
There's no...buffer zone.

227
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:19,633
So...

228
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:19,866
So...

229
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,300
we start to fool around,
and it's the first time,

230
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,000
and it's early in the going,

231
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:30,466
and I begin to perceive
this impending...

232
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,833
intestinal requirement...

233
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:37,333
whose needs are going to surpass
by great lengths

234
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:38,966
anything in the sexual realm.

235
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,566
So I know I'm gonna
have to stop,

236
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,500
and as this is happening,

237
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:49,633
I'm thinking even if I can
somehow manage to momentarily...

238
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:51,133
I'm thinking even if I can
somehow manage to momentarily...

239
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,833
extricate myself
from the proceedings

240
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:58,833
and relieve
this unstoppable force,

241
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:01,966
I know that that bathroom
is not gonna provide me

242
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
with the privacy
that I know I'm going to need...

243
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:07,000
This could only
happen to you.

244
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:09,533
So, uh...

245
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:12,266
I finally stop and say, um...

246
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,233
"Tatiana, I hope you don't
take this the wrong way,

247
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:19,366
but I think it would be best
if I left."

248
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,566
You said this
to her...after?

249
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,900
No.

250
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:28,166
During.

251
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,500
Oh, boy.

252
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:30,633
Yeah.

253
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,900
Wow. So?

254
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:36,000
So I'm dressing,
and she's staring up at me,

255
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:40,500
struggling to compute this
unprecedented turn of events.

256
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:42,566
I don't know what to say
to reassure this woman,

257
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,333
and worst of all,
I don't have the time to say it.

258
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:49,166
The only excuse
she might possibly have accepted

259
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,633
is if I told her
I am in reality Batman,

260
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:53,833
is if I told her
I am in reality Batman,

261
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:56,366
and I'm very sorry,
I just saw the Bat signal.

262
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,333
It took me three days
of phone calls

263
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:02,166
to get her to agree
to see me again.

264
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,833
Now she's waiting
for me to call,

265
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,200
and she's still
on the phone.

266
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:09,966
I hate this place.

267
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,333
I don't know why
we came here.

268
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,833
I am never coming
back here again.

269
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:14,900
Who is that woman?

270
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,633
Remember when you first went out
to eat with your parents?

271
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:20,400
Remember when you first went out
to eat with your parents?

272
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:24,166
Remember?
It was such a treat to go.

273
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,133
And they serve you
this different food

274
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,166
that you never saw before,

275
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,000
and they put it in front of you,

276
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:35,333
and it was such a delicious
and exciting adventure.

277
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:38,666
And now I just feel
like a big, sweaty hog

278
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,033
waiting for them
to fill up the trough.

279
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,833
Oh.

280
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:44,766
She's off.

281
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:49,333
Jerry,
talk to that guy again.

282
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:49,633
What am I gonna say?

283
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:50,466
What am I gonna say?

284
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,166
Tell him we want
to catch a movie

285
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,766
and that we're late.

286
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:57,866
Hey.

287
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,033
What stinks in here?

288
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:03,866
Mr. Cohen, haven't seen you
for a couple of weeks.

289
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,500
Well, I've been looking
for a better place.

290
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:06,500
[LAUGHS]

291
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:08,733
Better place.

292
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:10,333
Want a--?
Want a table?

293
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:13,100
No, just bring me a plate,
and I'll eat here.

294
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,500
Bring him a plate.

295
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,000
He'll eat here!

296
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,033
Come on. I'll give you a table.

297
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,366
Excuse me.

298
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:27,166
We've been waiting here.

299
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,233
Now, I know we were ahead
of that guy. He just came in.

300
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:33,400
Oh, no. Mr. Cohen always here.

301
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:36,500
He's always here.
What does that mean?

302
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:37,833
What does that mean?

303
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:43,400
Oh, Mr. Cohen very nice man.
He live on Park Avenue.

304
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,566
Where am I?

305
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,633
Is this a dream?

306
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:51,333
Is this a dream?

307
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:54,600
What in God's name
is going on here?

308
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:57,700
She's not there.
She left.

309
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,233
She must have waited and left

310
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:01,400
because those people
wouldn't get off the phone.

311
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:02,866
Did you leave a message?

312
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,733
Yeah, I told her to call me here

313
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:06,333
and to tell anyone that answers
the phone

314
00:13:06,366 --> 00:13:09,666
to ask for a balding stocky man
with glasses.

315
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,433
I better tell them
I'm expecting a call.

316
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,466
Uh, Jerry,
here comes that woman.

317
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,666
Where do I know her?

318
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:19,633
Hi, Jerry.

319
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,500
Hi, Jerry.

320
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,233
Hey!

321
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,733
How are you doing?

322
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:28,633
How is everything?

323
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:32,266
Good, good, good.

324
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:35,033
What's going on?

325
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:37,900
Oh, working hard. And you?

326
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:41,666
Oh, you know,
working around.

327
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,500
Same stuff.

328
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,000
Doing...

329
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,400
whatever.

330
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:49,633
Well, you haven't been
around in a while.

331
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:50,466
Well, you haven't been
around in a while.

332
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,200
I know.
I know. Well...

333
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,066
You know.

334
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,066
You should come by.

335
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,900
Definitely.

336
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:01,500
I plan to.

337
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:03,600
I'm not just
saying that.

338
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:07,033
Hi. I'm Elaine.

339
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:09,333
Oh, Lorraine Catalano.

340
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:14,200
Lorraine,
this is Elaine.

342
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,833
[SIGHS]

343
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:19,633
[SIGHS]

344
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:20,233
[SIGHS]

345
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,633
Well, it was nice
seeing you, Jerry...

346
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,833
and nice meeting you.

347
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:27,533
Oh, nice to meet you too,
Lorraine.

348
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,666
Oh, my God, Lorraine.

349
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,033
That's Lorraine
from my uncle's office.

350
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:35,833
I am in big,
big trouble.

351
00:14:35,866 --> 00:14:37,833
The one you broke
the plans with tonight?

352
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:39,833
Yeah, she works in his office.

353
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:40,966
Now she's gonna

354
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,966
see him tomorrow

355
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,400
and tell him she saw me here
tonight.

356
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:45,633
He's gonna tell his wife.

357
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,000
His wife's gonna
call my mother...

358
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,633
Oh, this is bad.
You don't know.

359
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:51,166
Oh, this is bad.
You don't know.

360
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,333
The chain reaction
of calls

361
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:55,566
this is gonna set off.

362
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,533
New York,
Long Island, Florida.

363
00:14:57,566 --> 00:15:00,666
It's like
the Bermuda Triangle.

364
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,733
Unfortunately,
nobody ever disappears.

365
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:06,633
My uncle to my aunt,
my aunt to my mother,

366
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,666
my mother to my uncle...

367
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,200
And my uncle
to my cousin,

368
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:14,566
my cousin to my sister,
my sister to me...

369
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,400
You should've just had dinner
with your uncle tonight

370
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:17,533
and gotten it over with.

371
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:18,533
It's just a movie.

372
00:15:18,566 --> 00:15:20,400
Just a movie?

373
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:21,900
You don't understand.

374
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:24,800
This isn't <i>Plans 1-8</i>
<i>From Outer Space.</i>

375
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,566
This is <i>Plan 9.</i>

376
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,333
This is the one
that worked,

377
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:30,333
the worst movie ever made.

378
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:32,700
I'm really
looking forward to it.

379
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:35,466
Hey. I got news
for you.

380
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,866
If we're making
this movie,

381
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,133
we gotta get a table
immediately.

382
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,700
All right. Look it. Let's stop
fooling around.

383
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:39,909
Let's just slip him some money.

384
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:40,900
Let's just slip him some money.

385
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:43,266
In a Chinese restaurant?
Do they take money?

386
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:48,533
Do they take money?
Everyone takes money.

387
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:50,966
I went out with a guy
who did it all the time.

388
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,666
You just slip them 20 bucks.
Twenty bucks?

389
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,966
Isn't that excessive?

390
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,700
Well, what do you wanna
give him, change?

391
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,333
It's more
than the meal.

392
00:16:00,366 --> 00:16:01,500
Oh, come on.

393
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:03,233
We'll divide it up
three ways.

394
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:04,566
All right.

395
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,133
Seven, seven...

396
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,300
six.

397
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,909
I'm not gonna
eat that much.

398
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:10,333
I'm not gonna
eat that much.

399
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:13,966
I'm counting
your shrimps.

400
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,566
Okay,
who's gonna do it?

401
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,866
Oh, no.
I can't do it.

402
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,233
I'm not good at these things.
I get flustered.

403
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:21,666
Once I tried
to bribe an usher

404
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,700
at the roller derby.

405
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,833
I almost got arrested.

406
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:26,033
I guess it's you, Jer.

407
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:27,400
Me? What about you?

408
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:30,566
Oh, I can't do that.
It's a guy thing.

409
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,500
The women's movement

410
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,333
just can't seem
to make any progress

411
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:36,366
in the world of bribery,
can they?

412
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:39,766
Give me the money.

413
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,366
[COUGHS]

414
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,833
How's it going?

415
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,766
Very busy.

416
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:05,000
Boy, we are
really anxious

417
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:07,500
to sit down.

418
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:09,909
Very good specials
tonight.

419
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:10,000
Very good specials
tonight.

420
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,200
If there's anything
you can do

421
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,333
to get us a table,

422
00:17:18,366 --> 00:17:20,300
we'd really
appreciate it.

423
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,166
Oh, what is your name?

424
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,733
No, no.
I want to eat now.

425
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:26,900
Yes,

426
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:28,500
whole sea bass dinner tonight,
very fresh.

427
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:31,200
Here. Take this.
I'm starving.

428
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:33,200
Take it.
Take it.

429
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:39,066
Uh...Dennison, four!

430
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,533
Your table is ready.

431
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:45,500
No, no, no.
I want that table!

432
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:47,700
I want that table.

433
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,300
Oh, come on. Did you see that?

434
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,133
What was that?
He took the money.

435
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,333
He didn't give us
a table.

436
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:54,366
You lost the 20.

437
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,833
Well...
How could he do that?

438
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:58,000
You didn't make it clear.

439
00:17:58,033 --> 00:17:59,166
Make it clear?

440
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,166
What a sorry exhibition
that was.

441
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,800
All right,

442
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,366
let me get
the money back.

443
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:15,500
Excuse me.

444
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:18,133
I realize this is
extremely embarrassing.

445
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,533
My friend here apparently
made a mistake.

446
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:22,533
Your name?

447
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:26,200
Seinfeld.

448
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:27,900
Yes, Seinfeld, four.

449
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,033
No, no, no.

450
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,866
Do you see the girl
with the long hair?

451
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,466
Oh, yes, yes.

452
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,833
Very beautiful girl.
Very beautiful.

453
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,066
Your girlfriend?

454
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,909
Well, actually, we did date
for a while, but...

455
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:41,333
Well, actually, we did date
for a while, but...

456
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:43,400
that's really
not relevant here.

457
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:45,833
Relationships are difficult.

458
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:48,066
It is very hard
to stay together.

459
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,200
All right, listen.
All right.

460
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,866
How much longer
is it gonna be?

461
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,533
Oh...

462
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,233
Be about five, 10 minutes.

463
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,966
GEORGE: So?

464
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,909
There seems to be
a bit of a discrepancy.

465
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:10,000
There seems to be
a bit of a discrepancy.

466
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:11,500
So when are
we gonna eat?

467
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:13,966
Five, 10 minutes.
Oh.

468
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,066
We should've
left earlier.

469
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,066
I told you.

470
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,666
I don't see any way
we can eat

471
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,833
and make this movie.

472
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,500
Oh, well, I have to eat.
Let's order it to go.

473
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,666
We'll eat it in the cab.
Eat it in the cab?

474
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,166
Chinese food in a cab?

475
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,500
We'll eat it
in the movie.

476
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,000
Where do you think
you're going?

477
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,333
Do you think that they have
big picnic tables there?

478
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:32,866
Well, what do you
suggest?

479
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,833
I say we leave now,

480
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:37,333
we go to Sky Burger,
and we scarf 'em down.

481
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:38,800
I'm not going
to Sky Burger.

482
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,833
Besides,

483
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:39,909
it's in the
opposite direction.

484
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:41,000
it's in the
opposite direction.

485
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:42,633
Let's just eat popcorn
or something.

486
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,800
Cartwright?

487
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,833
I can't have popcorn for dinner.

488
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:47,833
MAITRE D':
Cartwright!

489
00:19:47,866 --> 00:19:49,933
I have to eat!

490
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,833
Well, they have
hot dogs there.

491
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:55,700
Oh, movie hot dogs.

492
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:58,366
I'd rather lick the food
off the floor.

493
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,566
I can't go anyway.

494
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,000
I have to wait here
for Tatiana's call.

495
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,500
Let me just check.
Excuse me.

496
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,466
I'm expecting a call.
Costanza.

497
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,366
Yes. I just got a call.

498
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,909
I yell...Cartwright!

499
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:10,500
I yell...Cartwright!

500
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:12,000
Cartwright!

501
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:14,700
Just like that.
Nobody came up. I hang up.

502
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:20,466
Well, was it
for Costanza or...

503
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,400
Yes, yes, that's it.
Nobody answered.

504
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:27,033
Was it a woman?

505
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:29,333
Yes, yes.

506
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:31,900
I tell her you not here.

507
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,033
She said curse word. I hang up.

508
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,909
She called.

509
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:41,166
She called.

510
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,166
He yelled, "Cartwright."

511
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,166
I missed her.

512
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,833
Who's Cartwright?

513
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:49,166
I'm Cartwright.

514
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,800
You're not Cartwright.

515
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,233
Of course I'm not Cartwright!

516
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:58,300
Look, why don't you two

517
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,000
just go to the movies
by yourself.

518
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:01,133
I'm not in the mood.

519
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,366
Well, me either.
I'm going to Sky Burger.

520
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,666
So you're not going?

521
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,666
You don't need us.

522
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,066
I can't go
to a bad movie

523
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,800
by myself.

524
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:09,909
What, am I gonna make
sarcastic remarks

525
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:11,533
What, am I gonna make
sarcastic remarks

526
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:13,666
to strangers?

527
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,500
I guess I'll just go
to my uncle's.

528
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:17,066
Should we tell him
we're leaving?

529
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,366
Oh, what for?

530
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,533
Let's just get out of here.

531
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:28,566
Seinfeld, four!

532
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,033
Hunger will make people
do amazing things.

533
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:35,133
I mean, the proof of that
is cannibalism.

534
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,200
Cannibalism. What...?

535
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:38,466
What do they say?

536
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,909
I mean, they're eating,
you know?

537
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:40,400
I mean, they're eating,
you know?

538
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:44,166
"This is good. Who is this?

539
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,000
I like this person."

540
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:48,566
You know, I mean...

541
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,166
I would think the hardest thing
about being a cannibal

542
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,133
is trying to get
some really deep sleep.

543
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,533
You know what I mean?
I would think you'd be like...

544
00:21:56,566 --> 00:22:00,233
"What is it? Who is that?
Who's there?

545
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:02,533
"Who's there? Is somebody there?

546
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:04,166
"What do you want?
What do you want?

547
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,333
"You look hungry.
Are you hungry?

548
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,000
Get out of here."

549
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,600
