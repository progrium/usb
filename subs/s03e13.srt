my favorite ride

2
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:05,366
was the bumper-car ride.
Remember that ride?

on the bumper cars

Do you remember this kid?

As soon as the ride
gets started,

00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:15,633
he'd be, like, stuck
in a pack of empty cars.

that other--

on the elevator?

522
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:33,995
I have my spare key
in your apartment, right?

523
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:35,141
Yeah, it's in
the kitchen drawer.

524
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:35,195
Yeah, it's in
the kitchen drawer.

525
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:36,828
Give me your key.
I gotta get it.

526
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,128
All right, what happened?
Never mind

527
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:39,828
what happened, just...

528
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:40,828
give me the key.

529
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:42,328
Come on,
I'll go with you.

530
00:21:42,362 --> 00:21:44,062
Here. Pay.

531
00:21:45,562 --> 00:21:47,395
Wait, wait, wait.
Give me that.

532
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,628
All right.

533
00:21:57,228 --> 00:22:00,495
So I take the subway
down to Coney Island

534
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,995
to go on the Cyclone.
I'm riding on the subway.

535
00:22:03,028 --> 00:22:05,141
I'm sitting on the D train
for an hour and 15 minutes

536
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:06,328
I'm sitting on the D train
for an hour and 15 minutes

537
00:22:06,362 --> 00:22:09,162
to go on a scary ride.

538
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,495
Okay, how dumb is that?

539
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:13,462
You know that first sharp drop
on the Cyclone?

540
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:15,062
Fell asleep.
