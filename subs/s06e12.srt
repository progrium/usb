1
00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:05,400
Loyalty to any one sports team
is pretty hard to justify.

2
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:07,200
Because the players
are always changing,

3
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:08,666
the team can move
to another city.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,466
You're actually rooting
for the clothes

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,000
when you get right down to it.

6
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:14,366
I mean, you are standing
and cheering and yelling

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,000
for your clothes to beat
the clothes from another city.

8
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,000
Fans will be so in love
with a player,

9
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:23,033
but if he goes to another team,
they boo him.

10
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:25,366
This is the same human being
in a different shirt.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,000
They hate him now.

12
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:28,900
"Boo!

13
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:30,000
"Different shirt.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,066
"Different shirt.

15
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,833
Booooo."

16
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:37,733
Sure you don't
want the tickets?

17
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:38,833
No thanks.

18
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:40,333
I can't believe
I'm having trouble

19
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:41,866
getting rid of
Super Bowl tickets.

20
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,666
I'm telling you, skip the
Drakes' wedding. Go to the game.

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,033
I can't. The Drake put me
in the wedding party.

22
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:49,566
Well, who schedules his wedding
on Super Bowl Sunday?

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,733
Maybe he didn't know.

24
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:52,300
Lemme see.

25
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,966
I can't believe you
got these for free.

27
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:56,700
Row F.

28
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:57,733
In front of the Gs.

29
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,400
Hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.

30
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:01,566
What about Kramer or Elaine?
They don't want them?

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,966
I asked.
Elaine laughed at me.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,910
Kramer's only interested
in Canadian football.

33
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,033
Kramer's only interested
in Canadian football.

34
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,400
Well, wish
I could help you.

35
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:08,400
Come on. Take 'em.

36
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:10,466
You could take Bonnie.

You payin' my hotel
and airfare to Miami?

What do you think?

39
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:17,033
So in order to use these,
I gotta spend, like, 1500 bucks.

40
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:19,366
This is a bill for $1500.

41
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,533
Plus, she'd ask about
the sleeping arrangements.

42
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:23,800
I find those sleeping-
arrangement conversations

43
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:24,833
depressing.

44
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,366
Yeah.
Sleeping arrangements.

his Thanksgiving party?

00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,500
Oh, no. I explained
the whole thing to him.

Or...maybe he liked
your gift so much

he decided to get me
the same thing.

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,700
Perhaps it's an homage.

00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,466
Yeah, perhaps.

137
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,233
How did he react
when you gave it to him?

138
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:19,533
Um, he said,
"Oh, a label maker.

00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:21,200
How about that?"

140
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,233

of the gift?

Yeah. So?

142
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,333
If you repeat
the name of the gift,

00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,533
you can't possibly like it.

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,166

opens something up

What are you gonna
do about it?

I'll just get invited up

I don't know. I guess
I'll just get invited up

150

to his apartment and...

151
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,833
see if he's got a label maker.

152
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:41,200
Why'd you get him
a gift anyway?

153
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,366
He did some dental work for me
and didn't charge me,

154
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,300
so I thought I'd get him
a Christmas present.

for his birthday, I'm a large.

00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,666
No, I don't think
you mentioned him.

180
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,400
He's a great guy.

181
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:46,400
You'll really like him.

182
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,266
I'm sure I will.

183
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,733
JERRY:
Male roommate?

184
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,866
Yes, a male roommate.

185
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,066
And this is a problem?

186
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,233
It's a huge problem, Jerry.

187
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:58,200
The hardest part about
having sex with a woman

188
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,966
is getting her
to come back to your place.

189
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,333
He's already got that.

190
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:03,333
Well, maybe he's--

191
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:04,910
No, believe me, he's not.

192
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,566
No, believe me, he's not.

193
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
So he's
an eligible receiver.

194
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,133
[SNAPS]

195
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,400
She's confiding in him
about our dates.

196
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:12,566
You always like the person
you talk to about the date

197
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,866
more than the date.

198
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,833
It's just a matter of time
until they realize,

199
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,000
"Hey! We could have sex."

200
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,366
What's stopping 'em?
Exactly.

201
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,833
You know how they get animals
to reproduce in captivity?

202
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:23,733
They just put 'em
in the same cage.

203
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:24,733
What does he look like?

204
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:26,066
Oh, that's the worst part of it.

205
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,066
He looks just like me.

206
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,533
He looks like you, and he's
workin' from the inside?

207
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:33,566
I look like me, and I'm
workin' from the outside.

208
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,910
Who do you think's in
the better position?

209
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,366
Who do you think's in
the better position?

210
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,033
Not you.

211
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:39,133
This bizarre Harrad Experiment
must end!

212
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,533
We'll take
a check, please.

213
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:44,533
I gotta find a way to work
this out. I love that apartment.

214
00:06:44,566 --> 00:06:46,933
It's so cozy.
I'm ensconced in velvet.

215
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:50,233
If it was socially acceptable--

216
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:54,033
I know, you would
drape yourself in velvet.

217
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:55,200
I've said that before?

218
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:56,733
Many times.
You love velvet.

219
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:57,900
You wanna live in velvet.

220
00:06:57,933 --> 00:06:59,900
Everything with the velvet.

221
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:02,666
Hey.
Hey. Hey.

222
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,733
Guess what.

223
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:04,910
I saw Newman talkin'
to the super.

224
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,566
I saw Newman talkin'
to the super.

225
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,700
So what?

226
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:09,233
The super has keys
to your apartment.

227
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:10,900
Don't you see
what's goin' on?

228
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:13,700
Newman is plannin'
a sneak-attack.

229
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,500
Oh, maybe he's got
no hot water.

230
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:16,700
Yeah.
All right. Fine.

231
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,333
You sit there, and you watch,

232
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:19,900
while Newman
takes over the world.

233
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:21,666
But he'd be a horrible leader.

234
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,233
And you know
who's gonna suffer?

235
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:25,633
The little people.
You and George.

236
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,533
JERRY: Are you through?
KRAMER: All right, all right.

237
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:30,900
Oh! I talked to
Arthur Jobania.

238
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,800
Yeah, the Drakes' wedding,
that's off.

239
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,533
The wedding's off?
What happened?

240
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:34,910
The Drake, he found out
that the wedding's

241
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,366
The Drake, he found out
that the wedding's

242
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,733
on the same day
as the Super Bowl.

243
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,733
So he wanted to postpone it.

244
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:42,866
They got in a big argument,
and...

245
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,866
Ka-pow! It's over.

246
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,333
GEORGE:
The wedding is off.

247
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:50,666
Now you can go
to the Super Bowl.

248
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,000
I can't call Tim Whatley
and ask for the tickets back.

249
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:55,366
You just gave them
to him two days ago.

250
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,300
He's gotta give you
a grace period.

251
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:01,900
Are you even vaguely familiar
with the concept of giving?

252
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:04,100
There's no grace period.

253
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,966
Well, didn't he re-gift
the label maker?

254
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,200
Possibly.

255
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:12,066
Well, if he can re-gift,
why can't you de-gift?

256
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:15,333
You may have a point.

257
00:08:15,366 --> 00:08:16,900
I have a point.
I have a point.

258
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,300
All right, I'll call him.

259
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,900
Good. What's that?

260
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,233
Oh, it's Risk.

261
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:23,966
It's a game of world domination

barely run their own lives.

263

Hello, Tim.

Yeah, hi, it's

Hey, remember those
tickets I gave you?

Well, it turns out
I can use them.

Well, it turns out
I can use them.

268
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:37,833
Oh, you do?

269
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:38,900
I understand.

270
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:40,900
Okay. Bye.

271
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:43,000
He already made plans.
He can't change 'em.

272
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,166
Well, they're his tickets.

273
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,066
He can do what he wants
with them.

274
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,066
Thanks.

275
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,566
All right. I gotta
go to Bonnie's.

276
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,333
What are you gonna do
about the roommate?

277
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:52,733
I gotta try and figure out
a way to switch places with him.

278
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,700
It's like
a Siegfried & Roy trick.

279
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:57,366
Well, the pickle breath
is a good start.

00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:04,733
Hello, Jerry.

00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:04,910

What do you want?

[GRUNTING]
Nothing.

285
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:14,166
Just being neighborly.

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
You wanna hang out,
shoot the breeze?

I'm not lettin'
you cheat, Newman.

You're not gettin'
anywhere near that board.

Jerry,
I'm a little insulted.

290

You're not a little
anything, Newman.

291
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:26,200
So just pack it up
and move it outta here.

00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:29,033
Oh, uh, by the way.

00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:30,633
What are you doing
for the Super Bowl?

295
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,166
I don't know. Watch it
on TV, I guess. Why?

296
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,910
Well, if you watch closely
enough, you just might see me.

297
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,533
Well, if you watch closely
enough, you just might see me.

00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:37,166
I'll be the one

You're going?

301
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,166
Yes, I am. A guy on
my mail route just

302
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,366
got a couple of tickets,
and he offered one to me.

303

What's his name?
Tim Whatley.

304
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:46,833
That's my ticket.

305
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:50,566
Is it? Oh, well,
if only you'd known,

306
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,866
you could have saved some time
and given it directly to me.

What a movie.

00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:02,633
Good choice.

00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,066
Thank Scott.
He recommended it.

Yes, he is.
Yes, he is.

[CLEARS THROAT]

318
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,300
When you're comin' out of the
shower and you put your robe on,

319
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,866
do you cinch it real tight?
Are you concerned about that?

320
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,166
George.

321
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,033
Do you hold the neck
together with one hand,

322
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:27,766
or you just letting it
flap in the breeze?

323
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:33,800
George, you're
being ridiculous.

What's the massage

Is there any work
being done?

Finger manipulation

But the table,
the stereo, the VCR, the...

531
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,733
The velvet couch!!

532
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:55,866
Where's the velvet?

533
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,633
They were his.

534
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:01,533
Besides, we don't need
any of those things.

535
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:03,062
We have each other.

536
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:03,166
We have each other.

537
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,133
NEWMAN:
Are you, um, sure you know where the impound yard is?

538
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,333
Oh, stop stalling.
Come on.

539
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:16,500
I can't think.
It's all this noise.

540
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:20,066
Or is it because I've built
a stronghold around Greenland,

541
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,666
I've driven you
out of Western Europe,

542
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,800
and I've left you
teetering on the brink

543
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,866
of complete annihilation?

544
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,300
I'm not beaten yet.

545
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,300
I still have armies
in the Ukraine.

546
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,966
KRAMER:
Yeah? The Ukraine.

547
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,062
You know what
the Ukraine is?

548
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:34,733
You know what
the Ukraine is?

549
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:36,000
It's a sitting duck.

550
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,133
A road apple, Newman.

551
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,000
The Ukraine is weak.

552
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:41,666
It's feeble.

553
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,633
I think it's time to put
the hurt on the Ukraine.

554
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,133
I come from Ukraine.

555
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,133
You not say Ukraine weak.

556
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,866
Well, we're playing
a game here, pal.

557
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,366
Ukraine is game to you?

558
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,300
How about I take your
little board and smash!

559
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,700
Ahh!

560
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,566
Hello, Tim.

561
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,633
Oh!

00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,062
Elaine, hi.

00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:03,133
Elaine, hi.

565
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,233
Don't worry, Tim.

566
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:05,566
I didn't come by
to yell at you.

567
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,133
I didn't come by
for that at all.

568
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:11,133
I just came by to pick up
my label maker.

569
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,133
I gave you a label maker,

570
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,233
and now I would like
to have it back.

571
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:16,466
But you gave it to me.

572
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,633
Ah! But you gave me a ticket
to the Super Bowl.

573
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,800
Hand it over, Whatley.

574
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,800
Uh...okay.

[SCOFFS]

576
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,466
You don't have
the label maker, do you?

577
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,466
Uh, no.

578
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
I knew it!
You're a re-gifter!

579
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:33,062
Oh, yeah. Some gift.

580
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:33,166
Oh, yeah. Some gift.

581
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,633
That thing didn't
work at all.

582
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,166
What?
You put a label on something,

583
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,366
then ten minutes later,
it would peel right off.

584
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,400
It was <i>the</i> worst gift
I ever got.

585
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,733
Well, I bought it for you
because...

586
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:50,700
you were so nice to me for not
charging me for the dental work.

587
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,233
The way you worked on
my filling, you were so...

588
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:59,333
So gentle and so caring.

589
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,200
And so sensitive.

Hello, Newman.

Hello, Jerry.

00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,800
Tim couldn't make it.

Oh.

Oh, it's enchanting.

to watch the Super Bowl.

Do you, uh...

609
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,062
at least have some towels
we could sit on?

610
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:03,733
at least have some towels
we could sit on?

00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:05,700

Scott's gonna drop by.

got his boxes.

You know, Bonnie, I...

620
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,900
I just had a pretty wild idea.

621
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:31,000
What is it?

622
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:32,900
Well, I, uh...

623
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:33,062
I'm not sure how you
pronounce it or anything,

624
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:35,133
I'm not sure how you
pronounce it or anything,

625
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,000
but I, uh...

00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:40,466
I believe it's <i>ménage à trois?</i>

00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,433

First, Kramer almost
beats me at Risk,

636
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:16,566
but I narrowly escaped,

637
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,666
and then Tim Whatley gives
me the Super Bowl ticket.

638
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,633
Can you move over at all?

639
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,333
And then-- Then just
as I'm about to go,

640
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:28,766
these boxes show up at
the post office with no labels.

641
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,200
No labels, Jerry.

00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:32,533

an inch?

Aw, come on.
