and leave it in the hallway

at 2:00 in the morning?

Why would they do that?

Sometimes,

in a little book.

with his knee.

531
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:13,100
Ugh. That was awful.
Poor Antonio.

532
00:21:14,366 --> 00:21:16,000
Oh. Thanks.

533
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:18,500
So... much longer?

534
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:19,500
Till when?

535
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:21,666
Till he goes back
to Seattle,

536
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,266
or till he can
feed himself?

537
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:29,433
I guess
it's not important.

538
00:21:31,866 --> 00:21:35,000
Take care of yourselves.

539
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:37,400
I should probably
get going too.

540
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:38,453
If I don't feed Paquita by 7:00,
she goes all over everything.

541
00:21:38,453 --> 00:21:40,066
If I don't feed Paquita by 7:00,
she goes all over everything.

542
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,900
Mm.

543
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,400
Take it easy.

544
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:44,500
Yeah.

545
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,566
How are you doing?

546
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,500
First of all, I can't believe
that people actually do fight.

547
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:57,000
People have fistfights in life.

548
00:21:57,033 --> 00:22:00,066
And I can't really believe
we have boxing, either.

549
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,566
It's really
kind of an amazing thing.

550
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,066
To me, the problem with boxing

551
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,400
is you have two guys
having a fight

552
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:07,400
that have no prior argument.

553
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:08,453
Why don't they have the boxers

554
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:08,666
Why don't they have the boxers

555
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,200
come into the ring
in little cars,

556
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:12,733
drive around a little bit,
have a little accident,

557
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:13,900
they get out--

558
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,733
"Did you see my signal?
Look at that fender!"

559
00:22:15,766 --> 00:22:17,766
Then you'd see a real fight.

560
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,566
