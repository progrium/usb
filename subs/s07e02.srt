So what?

525
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,800
Hey, all.

526
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:36,000
Georgie!
Congratulations!

527
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:37,866
Oh, my God!

528
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,610
I haven't seen you
since it happened.

529
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,066
I haven't seen you
since it happened.

530
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,800
I couldn't be happier for you.

531
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,666
Well, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

532
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,466
Oh, come on.
Come on.

533
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,766
You really,
really deserve it.

534
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:51,966
Deserve. I don't know
about "deserve."

535
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,066
Are you kidding?
I have seen the changes in you

536
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,400
the past couple of years.

537
00:19:56,433 --> 00:19:59,366
Man, you have grown.
You've matured.

538
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,466
[CHUCKLES]

539
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,300
Yeah,
I guess I'm getting older.

540
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,966
Oh. Well, I just think
it's wonderful.

541
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,066
Honestly.
I've gotta run.

542
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,610
But please, please,
give my best to Susan. Yeah.

543
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,633
But please, please,
give my best to Susan. Yeah.

544
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,866
My most just...

545
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,466
heartfelt congratulations.
Yeah, thanks.

546
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,966
Hey, listen,
if you ever get a date,

547
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,200
maybe the four of us
could go out together sometime.

548
00:20:21,566 --> 00:20:23,733
Yes.
Yes, yes. Sure.

549
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:26,633
Wasn't there some guy in your
building you said you liked?

550
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,133
He lived up
on the fifth floor or something?

551
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,400
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
Yeah.

552
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:34,400
Boy, she is something,
isn't she?

553
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,900
Yeah, she's something else.

554
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,233
Hey, so, what happened?

555
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:38,666
Did you hold your ground?
Or...?

556
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,610
Nope. I wept like a baby.

557
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,866
Nope. I wept like a baby.

558
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,133
What?

559
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,700
Well, I started to tell her,
and then all of a sudden

560
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:48,533
for some reason,
I just burst into tears.

561
00:20:48,566 --> 00:20:51,366
You cried?
I bawled uncontrollably.

562
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,500
I-I just poured my guts out.
And I'll tell you,

563
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:55,033
Jerry, it was incredible.

564
00:20:55,066 --> 00:20:57,833
I never realized
how powerful these tears are.

565
00:20:57,866 --> 00:20:59,800
I could've postponed it
another five years

566
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,866
if I wanted to.

567
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,166
Hey.
Hey.

568
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,533
Sorry about that movie thing.

569
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:05,733
I was joking around.

570
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,566
Sorry? Are you kidding?

571
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,366
You did me the biggest
favor of my life.

572
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,610
I spoke to a lawyer.
We're suing for millions.

573
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,366
I spoke to a lawyer.
We're suing for millions.

574
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,966
Suing? What for?

575
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,500
The coffee was too hot.

576
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:19,700
It's supposed to be hot.

577
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:20,866
Not that hot.

578
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,900
[♪]

579
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:33,833
The prophet Isaiah
tells us that without friends

580
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:36,966
our lives are empty
and meaningless.

581
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Don't--
Wait a minute. No. Whoa.

582
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:40,800
That's the rabbi
from Elaine's building.

583
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,333
I just met this guy
the other day.

584
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:46,466
<i>A young lady I know--</i>

585
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,933
<i>Let's call her Elaine.</i>

586
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:53,033
<i>--happened to find herself</i>

587
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:57,300
<i>overwhelmed with feelings</i>
<i>of resentment and hostility</i>

588
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,500
<i>for her friend.</i>

589
00:21:58,533 --> 00:21:58,579
<i>Let's call him George.</i>

590
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:00,233
<i>Let's call him George.</i>

591
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,633
<i>She felt that George</i>
<i>was somewhat of a loser</i>

592
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,733
<i>and that she was the one</i>
<i>who deserved</i>

593
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:11,166
<i>to be married first.</i>

594
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,966
<i>She also happened</i>
<i>to mention to me</i>

595
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,800
<i>that her friend</i>
<i>had wondered</i>

596
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:19,533
<i>if going to a prostitute</i>
<i>while you're engaged</i>

597
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:21,333
<i>is considered cheating.</i>

598
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:26,700
<i>His feeling was,</i>

599
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,579
<i>they're never going</i>
<i>to see each other again,</i>

600
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:28,966
<i>they're never going</i>
<i>to see each other again,</i>

601
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,866
<i>so, what's the difference?</i>

602
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,800
<i>But that is a subject</i>
<i>for another sermon.</i>

603
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:39,766
<i>And now I'd like to close</i>
<i>with a psalm.</i>
