hitting on Elaine
right in front of me.

356
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:58,000
He stands to make
a big commission too

357
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:01,500
on that jacket with the crest
that nobody seems to like.

358
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:05,666
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna take that jacket back.

359
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,566
I'm putting this guy
right out of commission!

360
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:09,943
All right.
I'm gonna turn in.

361
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:12,833
All right.
I'm gonna turn in.

362
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,066
Turn in?

363
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,700
Yeah, I had a tough day.

364
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,000
It's only 9:00.

365
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,300
Yeah, well, you know,

366
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,033
I don't argue
with the body, Jerry.

367
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:24,666
That's an argument
you can't win.

368
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,366
I can't go to sleep at 9:00.

369
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,333
Well, you can
go to your room and read.

370
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,966
Hey, look, you know,
you're the one who's locked out.

371
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,500
I'm letting you stay here.
You're wearing my bathrobe.

372
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:38,866
You should adapt to me.

373
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,943
But I'm tired.

374
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:40,800
But I'm tired.

375
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,800
Well, why don't you go
sleep at Newman's?

376
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,666
Oh, he's got
a girl up there.

377
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,000
This quilt is too thin.

378
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,533
Know I'm gonna get cold.

379
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:52,300
I don't even fit on this couch.

380
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,066
Don't even know
if I'm gonna sleep.

381
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,433
Well, that's all
I've got.

382
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,766
Well, can I sleep with you?

383
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:02,533
Huh?

384
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:06,233
Well, you've got
that big, comfortable bed

385
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:08,366
and that nice,
warm quilt.

386
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,943
Kramer, there's no way
you're sleeping with me.

387
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:11,800
Kramer, there's no way
you're sleeping with me.

388
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,233
Why?
Why?

389
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,233
Yeah.

390
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:16,900
Do I really have to
explain why?

391
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:17,900
Well, I--

392
00:13:17,933 --> 00:13:19,466
Hey.
Hey.

393
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,200
What's that?

394
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,233
Squire's walking stick.

395
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:25,633
I had to write about it
for the catalog.

396
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,166
Oh. Wow.

397
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,166
You want it?

398
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,300
Yeah.

399
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,233
You can have it.
I don't need it anymore.

400
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:33,933
Oh, mama.

401
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,943
Okay, so I am positive
you are wrong about Craig.

402
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:42,466
Okay, so I am positive
you are wrong about Craig.

403
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,866
Yeah, why?

404
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,800
Because he told a man
he'd give him a discount too.

405
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,200
A man, Jerry.

406
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:49,366
So? Who is he?

407
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,733
Some friend of his
from England.

408
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,866
Don't you see?

409
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,833
It's all a big scam.

410
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:56,200
You're nuts.

411
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,900
Well, how do you know
he's not wondering

412
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:59,366
the same thing about you?

413
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,800
What do you mean?

414
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,366
What do I mean?

415
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,700
Well, perhaps he thinks

416
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:06,300
that you're working him
for the discount.

417
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,033
Shaking that little butt
of yours

418
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:09,943
into big, big savings.

419
00:14:09,943 --> 00:14:11,033
into big, big savings.

420
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:12,166
Then when you get it,

421
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,133
you know, you drop him
like a hot potato.

422
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,366
Oh, please.

423
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,200
No, see, the two of you
need to work on trust.

424
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,833
And then, and only then,

425
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:23,266
will there be a free exchange
of sex and discounts.

426
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:27,866
The cornerstones
of a healthy relationship.

427
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,166
And now,
if you would excuse us,

428
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,900
we need to get to bed.

429
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,500
Yeah.

430
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:02,500
This patio furniture's
on sale.

431
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,633
Excuse me, uh...

432
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,666
I think I made
a big mistake.

433
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,943
I-I'd like my deposit back,
please.

434
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:10,400
I-I'd like my deposit back,
please.

435
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:11,900
What's the problem?

436
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:13,666
You got hookers turning
tricks in my car.

437
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,800
How's that for starters?

438
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,500
Eh, that is all hearsay.

439
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:18,066
All right, very good.

440
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,000
I'd like my car and
my deposit back, please.

441
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:21,500
Can't do it.

442
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:23,066
What do you mean?

443
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,666
If you read the agreement
you signed,

444
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,966
the deposit is nonrefundable.

445
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,033
Well, does it say anything
in the contract

446
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:30,466
about my car being used
as a whorehouse?

447
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,833
Because I don't remember
reading that clause either.

448
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,400
What can I tell you, buddy?

449
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,033
Take it up
with Consumer Affairs.

450
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:39,633
All right,
just give me my car

451
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:39,943
and let me get
the hell out of here.

452
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:41,133
and let me get
the hell out of here.

453
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,400
That's going to be
a problem.

454
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:46,366
Why?

455
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,566
It's all the way
in the back.

456
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,233
We can't get it out
for a couple of days.

457
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:52,900
What are you talking about?
I want my car.

458
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:55,366
We ask that you
please bear with us.

459
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,533
Bear with you?

460
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:59,133
This is a parking lot.

461
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,533
People are supposed to be
able to get their cars!

462
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:02,900
Ideally.

463
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:07,233
JERRY:
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to return

464
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,233
this jacket.

465
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:09,766
Certainly.
May I ask why?

466
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:12,233
For spite.

467
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:15,233
Spite?

468
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,566
That's right.

469
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,200
I don't care for the salesman
that sold it to me.

470
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:22,300
I don't think you can
return an item for spite.

471
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,500
What do you mean?

472
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:25,566
Well, if there was
some problem with the garment,

473
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,366
if it were unsatisfactory
in some way,

474
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,833
then we could do it for you.

475
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:30,200
But I'm afraid
spite doesn't fit

476
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:32,700
any of our conditions
for a refund.

477
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:34,366
That's ridiculous.
I wanna return it.

478
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,200
What's the difference
what the reason is?

479
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:37,500
Let me speak
with the manager.

480
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:38,533
Excuse me.

481
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:39,866
Bob?

482
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:39,943
This gentleman...

483
00:16:39,943 --> 00:16:40,866
This gentleman...

484
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,066
[WHISPERING]

485
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,700
...spite.

486
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,500
What seems to be
the problem?

487
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:49,966
Well, I wanna return
this jacket.

488
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,900
And she asked me why
and I said, "For spite,"

489
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:53,200
and now she won't
take it back.

490
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:55,033
Um, that's true.

491
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:59,133
We can't return an item
based purely on spite.

492
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,366
Well, so fine, then.
Then I don't want it.

493
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,866
That's why I'm returning it.

494
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,700
Well, you already said
spite, so...

495
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:08,033
But I changed my mind.

496
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:09,943
No. You said spite.

497
00:17:09,943 --> 00:17:10,333
No. You said spite.

498
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:12,166
Too late.

00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,566

It's the '90s.

Yeah, she's

and he's the wig master
for the show.

508
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,900
Oh, you're staying
with my friend George.

509
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:31,800
Right, George. I get the feeling
he doesn't want me there.

510
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,500
Ah, he doesn't even want
himself there.

All right.

514
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,333
I can't. I've gotta go
meet a friend.

00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,833
Oh, thanks.
Thanks very much.

520
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,333
Ever thought about selling it?
Would make a brilliant wig.

521

They make wigs
out of human hair?

522
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,533

are gonna have fun here.

I gotta get the Dreamcoat

Yeah, but you have
