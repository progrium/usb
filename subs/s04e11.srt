Well, my mother, Jerry.

353
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:05,763
But are you still
master of your domain?

354
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:10,096
I am king of the county. You?

355
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:11,896
Lord of the manor.

356
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:18,696
John F. Kennedy Jr.

357
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:20,863
What?

358
00:13:20,896 --> 00:13:24,196
He was in my aerobics class.

359
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:24,946
Really?
Did you talk to him?

360
00:13:24,946 --> 00:13:26,363
Really?
Did you talk to him?

361
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:27,863
No, you don't understand.

362
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:30,629
He was working out
in front of me.

363
00:13:30,663 --> 00:13:32,763
So, listen,
after the class was over,

364
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:34,163
I timed my walk to the door

365
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:36,363
so we'd get there
at the exact same moment,

366
00:13:36,396 --> 00:13:39,763
and he says to me,
"Quite a workout."

367
00:13:39,796 --> 00:13:41,363
"Quite a workout"?

368
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:42,763
What did you say?

369
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:45,029
I said, "Yeah."

370
00:13:45,063 --> 00:13:46,296
Good one.

371
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:48,029
So, then, listen,
listen.

372
00:13:48,063 --> 00:13:49,929
So then I showered
and I dressed,

373
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,029
and I saw him again
on the way out.

374
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:54,496
So we're walking and talking,

375
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:54,946
and he asked me my name,

376
00:13:54,946 --> 00:13:55,829
and he asked me my name,

377
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:59,296
and I think I said Elaine,
but, I mean, who the hell knows?

378
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:02,096
And so then he says to me,

379
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:06,663
"Do you want to split
a cab uptown?"

380
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:07,963
And I said sure,

381
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:10,329
even though
I was going downtown.

382
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:12,663
So...we get in the cab,

383
00:14:12,696 --> 00:14:16,096
and, I mean, I have no idea
where I'm going, right?

384
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:19,196
But this is John F. Kennedy Jr.
we're talking about.

385
00:14:19,229 --> 00:14:21,196
So then he says to me,
"Where do you live?"

386
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:23,196
And I-- And I was
close to your block,

387
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,196
so I said your building,

388
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:24,946
so he dropped me off in front,

389
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:25,996
so he dropped me off in front,

390
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:27,429
and I had to take a cab

391
00:14:27,463 --> 00:14:30,429
all the way back downtown
to my house.

Why outside here?

528
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:27,663
Because he thinks I live here.

we shared that cab?
