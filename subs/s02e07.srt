1
00:00:01,362 --> 00:00:02,345
Whenever I see the news,

2
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:05,461
and they're hauling in
some criminal terrorist

3
00:00:05,494 --> 00:00:07,761
psycho maniac mass murderer guy,

4
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:10,297
you notice he's always
covering up his face

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,064
with the newspaper,
with the jacket, with the hat?

6
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:13,530
What is he worried about?

7
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:15,530
I mean,
what is this man's reputation

8
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:19,030
that he has to worry
about this kind of exposure

9
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:21,497
damaging his good name?

10
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,052
I mean, what is he,

11
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:26,914
up for a big job promotion
down at the office or something?

12
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:29,328
Afraid the boss
will catch this on TV

13
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,000
and go,
"Isn't that Johnson from Sales?

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,163
and go,
"Isn't that Johnson from Sales?

15
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:34,397
"He's up in that clock tower

16
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,864
"picking people off one by one.

17
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:38,397
"I don't know
if that's the kind of man

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,897
"we want heading up
that new branch office.

19
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,397
"he should be
in Bill Collection.

20
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,997
I think he's got aptitude."

21
00:00:53,306 --> 00:00:54,488
[CHUCKLES]

22
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,288
She was great.

23
00:00:57,287 --> 00:00:59,053
You don't want to know.

24
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:03,787
Hey, remind me to tell you
what we did in Lake George, huh?

25
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,287
Get this.

26
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,587
I got it all on video.

27
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,587
That's it. This is it.

28
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:12,720
I'm done. Through.
It's over.

29
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:14,220
I'm gone. Finished. Over.

30
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:16,220
I will never work for you again.

31
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:17,553
Look at you.

32
00:01:17,587 --> 00:01:18,131
You think you're
an important man?

33
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:18,720
You think you're
an important man?

34
00:01:18,753 --> 00:01:19,753
Is that what you think?

35
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:21,220
You are a laughingstock.

36
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:22,720
You are a joke.

37
00:01:22,753 --> 00:01:24,653
These people
are laughing at you.

38
00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:25,787
You're nothing.

39
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,787
You have no brains,
no ability, nothing.

40
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,920
I quit!

41
00:01:38,253 --> 00:01:39,387
Hey.
Hey.

42
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,620
Boy, I have really
had it with Newman.

43
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:43,653
He wakes me up
again last night

44
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:44,887
at 3:00 in the morning

45
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,920
to tell me he's going
up onto the roof

46
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:47,953
to kill himself.

47
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:48,131
Well, what did you say?

48
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:48,953
Well, what did you say?

49
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:51,720
I said, "Jump."

50
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:54,120
He's been threatening
to do this for years.

51
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:56,220
I said, "If you're going
to kill yourself,

52
00:01:56,253 --> 00:01:57,220
"do it already

53
00:01:57,253 --> 00:01:58,720
and stop
bothering me."

54
00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:01,453
At least I'd respect the guy
for accomplishing something.

55
00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:04,053
What's his problem?

56
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:05,887
No job, no women.

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,420
He called the right guy.

58
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:11,220
I mean, what am I supposed
to tell him?

59
00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:13,153
How much there is
for him to live for?

60
00:02:13,187 --> 00:02:15,720
Why should I lie to him?

61
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:18,131
All right, I'm leaving.
I'm going to the laundry.

62
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:18,320
All right, I'm leaving.
I'm going to the laundry.

63
00:02:18,353 --> 00:02:20,987
Why don't you use the machines
down in the basement?

64
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,453
Fluff and fold,
the only way to live.

65
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:26,453
I drop it off, I pick it up.

66
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:27,920
It's a delight.

67
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:29,720
How about if I
put a few things--

68
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:31,487
Wait a second.
I don't want to do that--

69
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,720
No, you're going over there--

70
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,620
No, I don't want
to mix in everything.

71
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:38,387
My guys don't know your guys.

72
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,887
You can't just lock them all
in the same machine together.

73
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,320
They'll start a riot.

74
00:02:44,353 --> 00:02:46,387
Have you ever met my guys?

75
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,131
No, I can't say as I have.

76
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:48,153
No, I can't say as I have.

77
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:49,553
Well...

78
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,753
All right, put them on top.

79
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:53,620
On top.

80
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:55,953
Oh, beautiful.

81
00:02:55,987 --> 00:02:58,220
This stuff on top
is my friend's.

82
00:02:58,253 --> 00:03:00,653
could I get it done
in a separate machine?

83
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:02,320
I'll have to charge you
for another machine.

84
00:03:02,353 --> 00:03:03,553
Whatever it costs.

85
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:05,053
In fact, I would prefer it

86
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:08,553
if the machines are not even
touching each other,

87
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:10,953
because something could,
you know, jump across.

88
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:13,753
Guess what?

89
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,987
How did you know
I was here?

90
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,131
Kramer. Guess what?

91
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:18,287
Kramer. Guess what?

92
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,487
I don't know.

93
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,553
I quit my job.

94
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:21,553
Get out of here.

95
00:03:21,587 --> 00:03:23,220
I couldn't take it
anymore.

96
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:25,487
You can have this
on Monday.

97
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,920
What happened? Levitan?

98
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:28,920
I go in to use
his private bathroom,

99
00:03:28,953 --> 00:03:30,387
everybody uses it,

100
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,087
and then I get a memo--
a memo--

101
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,087
telling me to use
the men's room in the hall.

102
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,553
I mean, we share it
with Pace Electronics.

103
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:38,587
It's disgusting.

104
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,387
You and your toilets.

105
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,253
I snapped.
It was the last straw.

106
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:45,887
So what are you
going to do now?

107
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,887
Are you going to look

108
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,131
for something else
in real estate?

109
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:48,220
for something else
in real estate?

110
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:49,753
Nobody's hiring now.
The market's terrible.

111
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,520
So what are you
going to do?

112
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:59,320
I like sports.
I could do something in sports.

113
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:04,420
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

114
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,753
In what capacity?

115
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,720
You know,

116
00:04:09,753 --> 00:04:12,587
like the general manager
of a baseball team.

117
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:18,131
Yeah, well,
that can be tough to get.

118
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:18,887
Yeah, well,
that can be tough to get.

119
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,387
Well, it doesn't even have to be
the general manager.

120
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,953
Maybe I could be, like,
an announcer,

121
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:25,320
like a color man.

122
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:27,553
You know, how I always make
those interesting comments

123
00:04:27,587 --> 00:04:28,587
during the game?

124
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:32,653
Yeah, yeah,
you make good comments.

125
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:33,720
So what about that?

126
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:35,087
Well, you know,

127
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,220
they tend to give those jobs
to ex-ballplayers

128
00:04:38,253 --> 00:04:42,753
and people that are, you know,
in broadcasting.

129
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,131
Well, that's really not fair.

130
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:48,320
Well, that's really not fair.

131
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:50,387
I know.

132
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,320
Well, okay, okay.

133
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:55,387
What else do you like?

134
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,487
Movies. I like to watch movies.

135
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,453
Yeah, yeah.

136
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:02,387
Do they pay people
to watch movies?

137
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,987
Projectionists.

138
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,120
That's true.

139
00:05:08,153 --> 00:05:11,420
But you got to know
how to work the projector.

140
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:13,387
Right.

141
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,387
And it's probably a union thing.

142
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,131
Those unions.

143
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:19,153
Those unions.

144
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:20,887
Okay, sports...

145
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,220
movies...

146
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:26,787
What about a talk show host?

147
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,387
Talk show host, that's good.

148
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,953
I think I'd be good at that.

149
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:35,220
I talk to people all the time.

150
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:37,887
Someone told me they thought
I'd be a good talk show host.

151
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,487
Really?
Yeah, a couple of people.

152
00:05:43,753 --> 00:05:45,920
How do you get that, though?
Where do you start?

153
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:48,131
Well, that's where
it gets tricky.

154
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:49,387
Well, that's where
it gets tricky.

155
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,220
You can't just
walk into a building and say,

156
00:05:51,253 --> 00:05:53,120
"I want to be a talk show host."

157
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,887
I wouldn't think so.

158
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,620
It's all politics.

159
00:05:57,653 --> 00:05:58,820
All right, okay,

160
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:01,720
sports, movies,
talk show hosts.

161
00:06:01,753 --> 00:06:03,953
What else?

162
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:10,220
This could have been
a huge mistake.

163
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:12,220
Yeah, well, it doesn't sound

164
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:14,787
like you completely
thought this through.

165
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,253
Guess not.

166
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:18,131
What should I do?

167
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:18,653
What should I do?

168
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:20,820
Maybe you can just go back.

169
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:22,153
Go back?

170
00:06:22,187 --> 00:06:23,220
Yeah.

171
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:25,087
Yeah.
Pretend like it never happened.

172
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,953
You mean just walk
into the staff meeting

173
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,087
on Monday morning

174
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,453
like it never happened?

175
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:31,720
Sure. You're
an emotional person.

176
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:35,787
People don't
take you seriously.

177
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,653
Just go back.

178
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:40,387
Pretend the whole thing
never happened.

179
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,387
Never happened.

180
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,553
I was blowing off

about the couple of times
I did work in an office

189
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,620
is that when you go in
in the morning,

190
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,387
you say hi to everyone,

191
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,987
and then for some reason,
throughout the day,

192
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,387
you have to continue
to greet these people

193
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,553
all day,
every time you see them.

194

"Morning, Bill. Morning, Bob.

196
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,653
10 minutes later,
you see them in the hall.

00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:16,653
"How you doing?"

198
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,131
Every time you pass,

00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:18,553
Every time you pass,

200
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:20,553
you got to come up
with another little greeting.

racking your brains.

00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,924
Everyone,
I want to propose a toast

543
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,857
to 10 great years
at Rick Barr Properties...

544
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,024
Uh, Rick...

545
00:20:13,057 --> 00:20:14,524
and all the people
in this room

546
00:20:14,557 --> 00:20:15,924
that made that possible.

547
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:16,924
Rick...

548
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:18,124
I'd also like
to welcome back

549
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:19,124
into the fold, our...

550
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:20,924
our little, shrimpy friend,

551
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:22,090
George Costanza,

552
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:23,424
who,

553
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:23,683
although he really didn't
have a very good year--

554
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:26,457
although he really didn't
have a very good year--

555
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,290
how you blew that McConnel deal,
I'll never know,

556
00:20:29,324 --> 00:20:31,424
but what the hell, huh?

557
00:20:31,457 --> 00:20:32,590
we've always enjoyed

558
00:20:32,624 --> 00:20:33,724
his antics
around the office.

559
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:36,790
Anything you want
to add to this?

560
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:41,290
Drink up!

561
00:20:47,824 --> 00:20:50,857
I like history. The Civil War.

562
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:53,683
Maybe I could be a professor
or something.

563
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:56,357
Maybe I could be a professor
or something.

564
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,757
Well, to teach something,

565
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,924
you really have to know
a lot about it.

566
00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:04,424
I think
you need a degree.

567
00:21:04,457 --> 00:21:06,024
Yeah, that's true.

568
00:21:09,124 --> 00:21:10,090
Hey, don't...

569
00:21:10,124 --> 00:21:11,957
What?

570
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:17,290
Oh, my God,
the money!

571
00:21:17,324 --> 00:21:18,424
The $1,500!

572
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:19,824
Where'd you find it?

573
00:21:19,857 --> 00:21:22,190
It was in my laundry.

574
00:21:22,224 --> 00:21:23,683
In your laundry?
The whole time?

575
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:26,357
In your laundry?
The whole time?

576
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:31,024
I told you not
to mix in our guys.

577
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:32,424
What did we figure

578
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,490
the damage
on that machine

579
00:21:33,524 --> 00:21:34,590
would be?

580
00:21:34,624 --> 00:21:36,857
It was about 1,200 bucks.

581
00:21:38,057 --> 00:21:39,924
Kramer!

582
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:42,424
That's Newman.

583
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:44,157
I'm on the roof!

584
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:51,757
Well? What are you waiting for?

585
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,957
Elaine, come on,

586
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:53,683
take a walk with me
down to the Laundromat.

587
00:21:53,683 --> 00:21:54,757
take a walk with me
down to the Laundromat.

588
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,357
I got to pay this guy
the money.

589
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,424
I like horses.

590
00:21:57,457 --> 00:21:59,657
Maybe I could be a stable boy.

591
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,090
KRAMER: You want
to shoot some pool

592
00:22:01,124 --> 00:22:02,757
tonight?

593
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,290
I can't.
I'm going to a movie!

594
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,424
Nah, it's probably
a union thing.

595
00:22:19,624 --> 00:22:21,257
People like the idea of revenge.

596
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:23,235
Have you ever
heard the expression,

597
00:22:23,268 --> 00:22:25,235
"The best revenge
is living well"?

598
00:22:25,268 --> 00:22:26,402
I've said this.

599
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:27,502
In other words,

600
00:22:27,535 --> 00:22:29,235
it means, supposedly,

601
00:22:29,268 --> 00:22:30,835
the best way
to get back at someone

602
00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:32,535
is just by being
happy and successful

603
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:34,368
in your own life.

604
00:22:34,402 --> 00:22:35,502
Sounds nice.

605
00:22:35,535 --> 00:22:36,668
Doesn't really work

606
00:22:36,702 --> 00:22:38,035
on that Charles Bronson
kind of life.

607
00:22:38,068 --> 00:22:39,668
You know what I mean?

608
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:40,835
Those movies
where his whole family

609
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:43,568
just gets wiped out
by some street scum.

610
00:22:43,602 --> 00:22:45,368
You know,
maybe you could go up to him,

611
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:46,435
"Charlie, forget the .357.

612
00:22:46,468 --> 00:22:47,878
"What you need
is a custom-made suit

613
00:22:47,878 --> 00:22:48,002
"What you need
is a custom-made suit

614
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,002
"and a convertible.

615
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,935
"New carpeting, French doors,
a divan.

616
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:53,602
That'll show those punks."
