1
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:03,533
I love when you get your car
back from the car place,

2
00:00:03,566 --> 00:00:05,866
and it's got that...
paper mat on the floor.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,033
Like they're so obsessed
with cleanliness.

4
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:11,633
They don't even
want their shoes to touch the carpet.

5
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,133
Meanwhile,
the mechanic comes out.

6
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,366
He looks like Al Jolson.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,333
He's covered in goo
from head to toe.

8
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:18,533
You can't even see him.

9
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:20,466
Although I prefer that
to when they have the lab coat,

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,666
the clipboard,
the nice glasses.

11
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,866
Now you know
you're getting screwed.

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,166
"Can I see it?"
"You better not.

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,800
"It's idling quietly
right now.

14
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,000
"I think it should
stay overnight.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,400
"I think it should
stay overnight.

16
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:31,633
"We wanna keep
an eye on it,

17
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,933
and we wanna keep the bill
running up."

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,466
You can tell the players
that I reimbursed the trainer

19
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,133
for the cigarettes
and the diet shakes.

20
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,533
The players will
be reimbursed?

21
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:46,833
The trainer, George.

22
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:48,700
Tell the players
I reimbursed the trainer.

23
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:51,233
What's the matter?
This is the third time I had to repeat myself.

24
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:52,866
Sorry, Mr. Wilhelm.
Sorry doesn't cut it.

25
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,833
We're running
a ball club here, George.

26
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:57,166
You've got to
pay attention.

27
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,500
I know, sir.
It won't happen again.

28
00:00:58,533 --> 00:00:59,966
Let me see. I, uh...

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,400
I had an assignment
for you.

30
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:04,333
Huh. Let me...
Let me think here.

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,800
PETERMAN:
Elaine.

32
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,233
Hi, Mr. Peterman.

33
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:19,700
You know
what a huge fan I am of John F. Kennedy.

34
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,000
I do.

35
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:24,366
It was the Peace Corps
that gave me my start in this business.

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,633
Clothing the naked natives
of Bangtubesh.

37
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,666
The Pygmy pullover.

38
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,733
(CLICKS TONGUE)

39
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:34,700
Sotheby's is
having an auction of JFK's memorabilia.

40
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:35,827
One item in particular
has caught my eye.

41
00:01:35,827 --> 00:01:37,966
One item in particular
has caught my eye.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,700
The presidential
golf clubs.

43
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,400
Oh.
To me,

44
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:44,400
they capture
that indefinable romance that was Camelot.

45
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:46,400
Eh. Whatever.

46
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:48,233
But unfortunately,
I will be out of town with my lady friend

47
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:50,466
and therefore
unable to bid on the lot.

48
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,566
I was hoping maybe
you would go in my stead.

49
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,500
Oh. Oh, yeah.
I'd be happy to.

50
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,133
How much do you
want this thing?

51
00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:00,000
I mean, you know,
how high are you willing to go?

52
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:03,333
I would see no trouble
in spending up to, say,

53
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:05,800
$10,000.

54
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,533
Have my secretary
give you a signed check.

55
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:09,333
Wow.

56
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,333
...when you're done, George,
and bring it directly to me.

57
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:19,200
Mr. Steinbrenner
is very interested in this.

58
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:21,700
Yes, sir.

59
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,300
Yes, George.

60
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,133
I want you to
make this project a top priority.

61
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,033
I will, sir.
Top priority.

62
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:29,433
Top priority, George.
Top priority!

63
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,827
So he walks
out of the stall.

64
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:36,400
So he walks
out of the stall.

65
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:37,966
He's been talkin'
the whole time.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,400
He pulled
an LBJ on you.

67
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:40,566
LBJ?

68
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,033
Lyndon Johnson
used to do that to his staffers.

69
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:44,133
No kidding?
Oh, yeah.

70
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,133
He'd hold national security
meetings in there.

71
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,400
He planned
the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.

72
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:52,000
Well, I still don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

73
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:54,333
I don't even know
what my assignment is.

74
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:56,833
Ask him to repeat it.
Tell him there was an echo in there.

75
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:59,300
I can't.
He's been on my case about not paying attention.

76
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,300
Besides, it's too late.
I already told him I heard him.

77
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,466
You know what you do?

78
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,000
Ask him
a follow-up question.

79
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:05,827
Tell him you're
having trouble getting started,

80
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:06,833
Tell him you're
having trouble getting started,

81
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:08,000
and you want
his advice.

82
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,066
Yeah.

83
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,600
Follow-up question,
that'll work.

84

Hey, bud.
Hey.

00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:15,033
Can I have my keys--
Yeah.

--back please.

You should
have come, Jerry.

88
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:19,000
We made quite a haul.

89

Where'd you go?
Price Club.

90
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,200
Why didn't you
take your car?

91
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,833
Ah, the steering wheel
fell off.

92
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:24,933
I don't know where it is.

93
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,633
What are you doing?
Don't throw that away.

94
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,666
Well, I'm not paying
the 5 cents for that stupid recycling thing.

95

All right, listen.
Can you give me a lift back to my place?

104
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,300
No, I can't.
I gotta pick up Elaine.

105
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,666
I'm taking her
to this Kennedy auction.

106
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,933
All right.
I'll see you later. All right.

107
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:58,300
What is this
"MI, 10 cents"?

108
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,666
That's Michigan.

109
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,466
In Michigan
you get 10 cents.

110
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,333
Ten cents?
Yeah.

111
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:05,827
Wait a minute. You mean,
you get 5 cents here and 10 cents there?

112
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:06,133
Wait a minute. You mean,
you get 5 cents here and 10 cents there?

113
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,033
Round up bottles here
and run them to Michigan.

114
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:09,233
No, that doesn't work.

your inventory,

117

and you blow
your margins on gasoline.

Trust me.
It doesn't work.

119
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,733
You're not talking that
deposit-bottles scam, are you?

120
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,066
No, no, I'm off that.

121
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,700
You tried it?

122
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,866
Oh, yeah, every which way.
Couldn't crunch the numbers.

123

00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,166
I think she wants
those clubs.

192
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,500
Do I hear 95?
Ninety-five hundred.

you had her there at 17,000.

Oh, that's right.
We forgot about those.

that's twice the amount I authorized you to spend.

I know, Mr. Peterman.

265
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:50,866
But-- But--
But once I saw them,

266
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,633
I just couldn't stand
to let anyone else have them.

267
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,866
And certainly not some
stuck-up candy-bar heiress

268
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,633

herself in public without any regard--

274
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,800
I just have
one little question about, uh, my assignment.

275
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,800
Yes. Well,
I trust things are moving smoothly.

00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,633
Yes, yes. Very smooth,
super smooth.

278
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,233
No, but I really
want to attack this thing.

You know,
sink my teeth into it.

So I-I was
just wondering...

281
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,827
what do you think would
be the very best way to get started?

282
00:10:35,827 --> 00:10:36,866
what do you think would
be the very best way to get started?

283
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,666
Get started?
I don't understand, George.

284
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,666
Well, I was wondering--
You mean you haven't been to payroll?

285
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,833
Payroll.
No, haven't done that. What's the problem?

286
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:45,966
Now, come on, George.

287
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,333
I told the big man
you were moving on this.

288
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:50,133

with that,

310
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,133
maybe you should just
take it up with him.

00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,266
Well, maybe I will.

312
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:48,033

00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:38,132
What?
It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!

349
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:38,874
What?
It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!

350
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:40,941
Look, Newman, I told you
to let this thing go!

351
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:42,307
No, no, no, listen to me.

352
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:44,707
Most days the post office
sends one truckload of mail

353
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,041
to the second domestic
regional sorting facility

354
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:48,707
in Saginaw, Michigan.
Uh-huh.

355
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:52,141
But on the week
before holidays, we a see surge.

356
00:13:52,174 --> 00:13:53,874
On Valentine's Day,
we send two trucks.

357
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:56,441
On Christmas,
four packed to the brim.

358
00:13:56,474 --> 00:13:59,407
And tomorrow,
if history is any guide,

359
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:02,574
we'll see some spillover
into a fifth truck.

360
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:04,307
Mother's Day.

361
00:14:04,341 --> 00:14:07,574
The mother of
all mail days.

362
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:08,132
And guess who's signed up
for the truck?

363
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:10,974
And guess who's signed up
for the truck?

364
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:13,041
A free truck?
(LAUGHS)

365
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:16,041
Oh, boy. That completely
changes our cost structure.

366
00:14:16,074 --> 00:14:17,941
Our G and A
goes down 50 percent.

367
00:14:17,974 --> 00:14:20,574
We carry a couple
of bags of mail, and the rest is ours!

368
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:23,707
Newman,
you magnificent bastard, you did it!

369
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:25,107

Yes, payroll.
Yes, I did.

378
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,474

379

be heading downtown, then, huh?

Oh, yeah.

381
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:50,941
Downtown.

382
00:15:50,974 --> 00:15:52,541
Definitely.

383
00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:54,407
Well, I'm very interested
to see how this thing turns out.

384
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:56,607

he didn't mention it

Hey.

00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:46,274
Where's the car?
Hi.

He's bringing it.
Good.

Okay. Thank you.

527
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:04,274
So, what did they say?

528

They're sending a detective
to my apartment tomorrow.

529
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:09,374
What the hell
were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?

530
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:11,041
Well, I didn't count on
my mechanic

531
00:21:11,074 --> 00:21:12,707
pulling a Mary Beth
Whitehead, did I?

532
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:14,874
Well, what kind of maniac
is this guy?

533
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:17,407
He's a very
special maniac.

What am I supposed
to tell Mr. Peterman?

535
00:21:19,174 --> 00:21:20,374
I don't know.

536
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:22,174
Why couldn't you take
better care of that car?

Well, are they here?

Snag.

542
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:38,874
It seems that
a psychotic mechanic

543
00:21:38,907 --> 00:21:42,574
has absconded
with my friend's car.

544
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:44,474
What does that
have to do with my clubs?

You know,
like mechanic's pants,

549

lose the car.

He panics
and does something rash.

I'm gonna ask you
some personal questions.

I'm sorry
if I touch a nerve,

558

with the case.

good care of the car?

Do you ride the clutch?

00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:25,541
Well,
what does it matter? It's my car.

00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:28,141
I can do whatever
I want with it.

think of doing
such things.

All right,
Mr. Seinfeld,

569
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:35,874
we'll let you know
if we find anything.

570
00:22:35,907 --> 00:22:37,807
I gotta be honest
with you.

end up well.

Well, whatever
you can do. Thanks.

Oh, Mr. Wilhelm,
about the project, sir.

574
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:51,607
That's what I came to
talk to you about.

575
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:54,741
Great job, George.
You really nailed it.

576
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,207
I did?

577
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:58,541
Oh, yes,
I read through it this morning.

578
00:22:58,574 --> 00:22:59,425
I couldn't have
done it better myself.

579
00:22:59,425 --> 00:22:59,874
I couldn't have
done it better myself.

580
00:22:59,907 --> 00:23:02,607
And I turned it
right over to Mr. Steinbrenner.

581
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:04,007
Good work, George.

582
00:23:07,307 --> 00:23:08,441
JERRY:
I don't get it.

583
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:09,807
He assigns it to you.

584
00:23:09,841 --> 00:23:11,241
You don't do it.

585
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:12,774
Somehow it gets done,

586
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:15,274
and now he's telling you
what a great job you did.

587
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:18,041
Maybe somebody did it
and didn't take credit for it.

588
00:23:18,074 --> 00:23:19,207
Maybe it was
already done

589
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:21,607
and didn't need doing
in the first place.

590
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:24,207
I have no idea
who did it,

591
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:27,041
what they did,
or how they did it so well.

592
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,574

and I don't care.

and I don't care.

planting the rose bushes, didn't he, dear?

You planted the rose bushes, dear.

597
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:41,641

00:23:56,574 --> 00:23:58,441
The point is,
however it got done,

605
00:23:58,474 --> 00:23:59,425
it's done.

606
00:23:59,425 --> 00:23:59,707
