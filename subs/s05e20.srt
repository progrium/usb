1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,133
To me, the thing about
birthday parties

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:05,966
is that the first and last
party you have

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,533
are actually quite similar.

4
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:09,333
You know, you just
kind of sit there.

5
00:00:09,366 --> 00:00:12,400
You're the least excited
person at the party.

6
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:15,300
You don't even really realize
that there is a party.

7
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,166
You don't know
what's going on.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,333
Both birthday parties,

9
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:20,233
people have to help you
blow out the candles.

10
00:00:20,266 --> 00:00:21,500
You can't do it.

11
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:23,166
You don't even know
why you're doing it.

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,966
What is this ritual?
What is going on?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,666
It's also the only two
birthday parties

14
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,233
where other people
have to gather

15
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:30,000
your friends together for you.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,966
your friends together for you.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,733
Sometimes they're
not even your friends.

18
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:35,133
They make the judgment.

19
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,466
They bring them in,
sit 'em down, and they tell you:

20
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,000
"These are your friends.

21
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:41,400
"Tell them
thank you for coming

22
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:43,000
to my birthday party."

23
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,200
WOMAN:
These are great! Just great!

24
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:50,200
Really great!

25
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:51,966
Really,
really great!

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,466
Don't you think so,
Elaine?

27
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,866
Yeah.

28
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,133
Really great.

29
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:59,400
Oh, a coffee table book
about coffee tables.

30
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:01,900
How did you come up
with this idea?

31
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:02,933
It was there.

32
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:04,900
Oh, look at this one.

33
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:06,633
It's saying,
"I'm a coffee table.

34
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,000
"Put some coffee on me.

35
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:10,233
Oh, the hotter the better.
That's what I'm here for."

36
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:13,700
Ah, you know, actually, I've
got some work I've gotta do.

37
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:14,378
How about if the book came
with these little foldout legs

38
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:16,733
How about if the book came
with these little foldout legs

39
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,800
so the book itself
becomes a coffee table.

40
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:21,533
Oh, that is
a great idea!

41
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:23,266
Really,
really great!

42
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:25,800
ELAINE:
"Ohh!

43
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,400
"and that coffee table
is saying,

44
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:30,366
put some coffee on me!"

45
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,866
I'd like to put
some coffee on her.

46
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,200
Hot, scalding coffee
right in her face.

47
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:36,833
I swear! This is like
working with a contestant

48
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:38,366
from <i>The Price Is Right.</i>

49
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,366
[FAKE LAUGHING]

50
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:43,400
Yeah, that's
real interesting. Elaine...

51
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:44,378
listen, tell me if
you think this is funny.

52
00:01:44,378 --> 00:01:46,533
listen, tell me if
you think this is funny.

53
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:49,500
"Men definitely hit the remote
more than women.

54
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:50,900
"Men don't care
what's on TV.

55
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:53,833
"Men only care
<i>what else</i> is on TV.

56
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,200
"Women wanna see
what the show is

57
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:57,633
"before they
change the channel

58
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,066
because men hunt
and women nest."

59
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,533
Yeah, it's funny.

60
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:01,666
I don't know.

61
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,000
You don't know?
Come on. That's gold!

62
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:07,233
Well, I don't know
about gold.

63
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:08,366
Oh, that's gold, baby.

64
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:11,800
Baby? What?
Are you doing George now?

65
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,133
Hey, I was saying "baby"
way before George.

66
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:14,378
Well, I don't know. Don't ask me
any more questions about jokes.

67
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:16,866
Well, I don't know. Don't ask me
any more questions about jokes.

68
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,900
Jerry, it just puts
too much pressure on me.

69
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:21,366
This guy Leonard Christian's
gonna be there tomorrow.

70
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,466
Yeah?
Who's he?

71
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,133
A writer from
<i>Entertainment Weekly.</i>

72
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,833
I would like to have
a good show.

73
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:28,333
<i>Danke schoön,</i>
my little dumplings.

74
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:29,466
Hi.

75
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,800
Hey, how 'bout
that Toby, huh?

76
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:31,866
Yeah,
how about her?

77
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,733
Ooh, she's a package
full of energy.

78
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:38,133
Yeah, she's a package
full of something.

79
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,566
And that something
is life.

80
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,233
You gotta meet this gal.
She's brimming with positivity.

81
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:44,233
Oh, please.

82
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:44,378
Hey, are you performing
tomorrow?

83
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:46,200
Hey, are you performing
tomorrow?

84
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,233
Yeah.
Great.

85
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,866
I'm gonna bring Toby.

86
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,633
You better laugh.
I'm being reviewed by Leonard Christian.

87
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,533
She's a great laugher.
Right, Elaine?

88
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:55,400
Oh, yeah.
She's a great laugher, Jerry.

89
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:59,366
"Ha-ha!
Really, really great!"

90
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,833
Well, you wanna
sit with George?

91
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:02,166
He's coming with Robin.

92
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,800
The waitress
from the comedy club? Yeah.

93
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,966
What about her kid?
Is she bringing him too?

94
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,966
She's got a kid?

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,133
Yeah. You should see George

96
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,733
get along with this kid.

97
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:13,300
GEORGE:
Ow! What are you doing under there?

98
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,378
Hey, hey, stop that.

99
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:14,466
Hey, hey, stop that.

100
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,400
Don't eat that.
That's not food!

101
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,133
He's sucking down
Equal packets.

102
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,300
Do you think 25 kids
is too much?

103
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,233
Twenty-five kids
for his birthday party?

104
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:25,233
Don't put your tongue
on the floor!

105
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:27,400
He's putting his tongue
on the floor.

106
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:28,400
Here, here.

107
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,566
Have some more
sugar packets.

108
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,366
So what about
entertainment?

109
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,466
Should I get Barney?

110
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,866
BOY:
No Barney!

111
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,400
Maybe a clown.

112
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:37,666
How about Bozo?

113
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,400
BOY:
Who's Bozo?

114
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,966
Who's Bozo?

115
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,166
Bozo the Clown.
That's who Bozo is.

116
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,378
When I was a kid, Bozo
the Clown was <i>the</i> clown.

117
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:45,966
When I was a kid, Bozo
the Clown was <i>the</i> clown.

118
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,133
George...

119
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,900
With the orange hair,
the ruffled clown shirt.

120
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:50,900
George...

121
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:52,000
A TV show.
Cartoons.

122
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,666
George!

123
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,533
Forget Bozo, George.

124
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:56,633
Bozo's out.

125
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,666
He's finished.

126
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,800
It's over for Bozo.

127
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,866
When I was a kid, we didn't
have these elaborate parties

128
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,633
with catered food
and entertainment.

129
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,533
I remember my seventh
birthday party.

130
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:09,533
Blow out the candles!
Blow out the candles!

131
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:11,533
I said blow out
the damn candles!

132
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:13,533
Stop it, Frank!
You're killing him!

133
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:14,378
Blow out the candles!

134
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:15,866
Blow out the candles!

135
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:20,500
Well, this time, you can
blow out the candles.

136
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:21,800
No. I have asthma.

137
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,066
Ow! Ben!
Ben!

138
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Hi.

139
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,500
Hi, Toby.

140
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:31,733
How are you
doing today?

141
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:33,266
Fine.

142
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:38,900
How are you?

143
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:40,166
Oh, I'm great.

144
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,333
Just great.

145
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:42,700
Really great.

146
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,378
Oh, hey, did you hear
about Bob Rosen?

147
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:46,533
Oh, hey, did you hear
about Bob Rosen?

148
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:48,033
No.

149
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:50,500
He's going to Knopf. He is going
to be a vice president.

150
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,000
Knopf? Really?

151
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:53,233
Boy...

152
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:55,500
that means there's
an opening here for...

153
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:56,500
senior editor.

154
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:59,033
Has Lippman, uh,
hired anyone?

155
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:02,000
No. I hear he wants to
promote someone in-house.

156
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,300
Really?

157
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,866
Maybe it'll be you.

158
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,800
Oh, well...

159
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,233
You really deserve it.

160
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:11,333
Oh, well...

161
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:13,066
I mean, you have
experience, seniority.

162
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,378
Lippman really
respects your opinion.

163
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:15,300
Lippman really
respects your opinion.

164
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:19,400
Well...

165
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:20,900
Well, it could be you.

166
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:21,900
No.

167
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,200
No, really.

168
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:24,966
Really?
You think so?

169
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,233
Sure.

170
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:28,700
Boy, wouldn't that
be exciting?

171
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,633
I mean, stranger things
have happened.

172
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,633
Wow! Me, a senior editor!

173
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,300
I'd like that.

174
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,400
You shouldn't
get your hopes up.

175
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:37,533
Oh, well...

176
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:38,700
It's a possibility.

177
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:42,166
Like you said, stranger
things have happened.

178
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,066

00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:37,239
Seemingly.

358
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:38,306
Seemingly.

359
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:39,572
To the untrained eye,

360
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:41,039
I can fully understand

361
00:11:41,072 --> 00:11:42,339
how you got
that impression.

362
00:11:43,506 --> 00:11:43,601
What looked
like pushing,

363
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:45,372
What looked
like pushing,

364
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:47,839
what looked like
knocking down,

365
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:49,306
was a safety
precaution.

366
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:50,306
In a fire,

367
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:51,572
you stay
close to the ground.

368
00:11:51,606 --> 00:11:52,572
Am I right?

369
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:54,306
Well...

370
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,072
And when I ran
out that door,

371
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:59,172
I was not leaving
anyone behind!

372
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:00,972
Quite the contrary.

373
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:03,172
I risked my life,

374
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:06,172
making sure
that exit was clear.

375
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:09,739
Any other questions?

376
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:12,306
How do you live
with yourself?

377
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:13,572
It's not easy.

378
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:19,006
So, she doesn't wanna
see me anymore.

379
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:25,006
Did you knock
her over, too,

380
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,439
or just the kids?

381
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:31,872
No. Her too.

382
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:33,672
And her mother.

383
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:35,006
Really? Her mother?

384
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,006
Yeah.

385
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:39,539
I may have
stepped on her arm too.

386
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:42,872
You probably couldn't see
because of the smoke.

387
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:43,601
Yeah.

388
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:44,206
Yeah.

389
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,372
But it was
somebody's arm.

390
00:12:45,406 --> 00:12:46,372
Mmm.

391
00:12:46,406 --> 00:12:48,572
So you feel...

392
00:12:48,606 --> 00:12:50,539
"women and children first"
in this day and age

393
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:52,906
is somewhat of
an antiquated notion.

394
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,206
To some degree, yeah.

395
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,539
So basically,

396
00:12:56,572 --> 00:12:58,806
it's every man,
woman, child and invalid

397
00:12:58,839 --> 00:12:59,872
for themselves.

398
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:02,339
In a manner
of speaking.

399
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:03,406
Yeah.

400
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:05,206
Well, it's honest.

401
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,506
She should be
commending me

402
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:09,039
for treating everyone
like equals.

403
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:12,572
Well, perhaps when she's
released from the burn center,

404
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:13,601
she'll see things
differently.

405
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:14,439
she'll see things
differently.

406
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:18,106
Perhaps.

407
00:13:19,406 --> 00:13:22,206
So, what was the fire,
just some greasy hamburgers?

408
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:23,472
Yeah.

409
00:13:23,506 --> 00:13:26,506
Eric, the clown, put it out
with his big shoe.

410
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:33,906
By the way,
did you see this?

411
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,972
No, what's that?

412
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:38,806
The Leonard Christian
article about my show.

413
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,306
Plus my gig in Miami
got canceled.

414
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:41,972
I betcha it's because
of the article.

415
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:43,306
Wow.

416
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:43,601
He really does
a number on you.

417
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:44,706
He really does
a number on you.

418
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:48,139
"Seinfeld froze like a deer
in the headlights

419
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:50,339
in the face of
incessant heckling."

420
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:53,406
I should've let her have it.
I held back because of Kramer.

421
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:55,172
You know what you
ought to do?

422
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:57,306
You should go to her office
and heckle her.

423
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:58,306
Yeah, right.

424
00:13:58,339 --> 00:13:59,506
Like all the comedians say,

425
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,906
"What if I came to your work
and heckled you?"

426
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:03,239
Yeah, that'd be something.

427
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:05,306
I'm not kidding.
You should do it.

428
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,072
But wouldn't that be
the ultimate comedian's revenge?

429
00:14:08,106 --> 00:14:09,972
I've always had a fantasy
about doing that.

430
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:12,006
Well, go ahead.
Do it.

431
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,239
Why can't I?

432
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:13,601
No reason.

433
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:14,306
No reason.

434
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,639
You know what?
I think I'll do that.

435
00:14:17,672 --> 00:14:18,872
She came down
to where I work.

436
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:20,639
I'll go down
to where she works.

437
00:14:20,672 --> 00:14:22,306
This is unprecedented.

438
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:23,606
There's no precedent,
baby.

439
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:28,439
What, you're using
my "babies" now?

440
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,006
Hey, nice shoes.

441
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,706
What, do you wear
sandals to work?

442
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:39,206
It's always nice to walk
in a room and get the aroma of feet.

443
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:41,672
That's real conducive
to the work atmosphere.

444
00:14:41,706 --> 00:14:43,472
I'm sure your coworkers
appreciate it.

445
00:14:43,506 --> 00:14:43,601
Hey, let's go eat
in Toby's office.

446
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:45,839
Hey, let's go eat
in Toby's office.

447
00:14:45,872 --> 00:14:49,039
Great idea. We can
check on her bunions.

448
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:52,406
You know, I have work
to do here. I'm very busy.

449
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:53,872
Oh, is this
disruptive?

450
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:56,406
You find it hard to work
with someone interrupting?

451
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:59,206
Well, how'd you like it
if I called security?

452
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:00,472
Security!

453
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:02,972
I don't know how you'll
make it in this business

454
00:15:03,006 --> 00:15:04,072
if you can't take it.

455
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:05,072
Oh!

456
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:06,472
You gotta be tough.

457
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,206
Boo! Boo!
Boo! Boo!

458
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:09,206
You know--

459
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,206
Hiss! Boo!

460
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,372
All right.
That's it.

461
00:15:11,406 --> 00:15:12,972
Get out of my way!

462
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:13,601
What's going on?
What's happening here?

463
00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:14,706
What's going on?
What's happening here?

464
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:15,706
Toby!

465
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:17,639
Sss! Boo!

466
00:15:17,672 --> 00:15:19,972
TOBY:
My pinkie toe!

467
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,339
KRAMER:
Toby!

468
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:22,372
Oh!

469
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:23,906
Oh!

470
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:27,872
KRAMER:
What did you go up there to heckle her for?

471
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:30,206
Because she came down
to the club and heckled me.

472
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,906
I gave her a taste
of her own medicine.

473
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:35,972
Oh, yeah! You gave her
a taste of medicine, all right.

474
00:15:36,006 --> 00:15:38,539
Well, I didn't want her
to have an accident.

475
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:39,672
What accident?

476
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,839
After he heckled Toby,
she got so upset,

477
00:15:41,872 --> 00:15:43,172
she ran out
of the building,

478
00:15:43,206 --> 00:15:43,601
and a street sweeper
ran over her foot

479
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:45,239
and a street sweeper
ran over her foot

480
00:15:45,272 --> 00:15:46,539
and severed
her pinkie toe.

481
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,372
That's
unbelievable!

482
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,006
Yeah. Then after
the ambulance left,

483
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,872
I found the toe.

484
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:55,339
So I put it in a Cracker Jack
box, filled it with ice

485
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,072
and took off
for the hospital.

486
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:58,072
You ran?

487
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:00,172
No. I jumped
on the bus.

488
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:02,672
I told the driver, "I got a toe
here, buddy. Step on it."

489
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,006
Holy cow!

490
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,006
Yeah, yeah.

491
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,539
Then, all of a sudden,

492
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:10,006
this guy pulls out a gun.

493
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,872
Well, I knew any delay's
gonna cost her her pinkie toe,

494
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:13,601
So I got out of the seat
and started walking towards him.

495
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:16,006
So I got out of the seat
and started walking towards him.

496
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:19,206
He says, "Where do you think
you're going, Cracker Jack?"

497
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,839
And I says, "Well, I got
a prize for you, buddy"

498
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:23,872
Plah! Plah! Keeyah!

499
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:26,072
Knocked him
out cold.

500
00:16:26,106 --> 00:16:27,372
How could you
do that?

501
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:28,906
Yeah, then everybody
is screaming

502
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:30,472
because the driver,
he's passed out

503
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:31,806
because of all
the commotion.

504
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,372
The bus is
out of control!

505
00:16:36,172 --> 00:16:38,339
So I grab him by the collar.
I take him out of the seat.

506
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,272
I get behind the wheel.
Now I'm driving the bus.

507
00:16:43,006 --> 00:16:43,601
You're Batman.

508
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:43,972
You're Batman.

509
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:45,872
Yeah. Yeah.
I am Batman.

510
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:47,472
Then the mugger,
he comes to,

511
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,906
and he starts
choking me,

512
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:50,972
So I'm fighting him off
with one hand,

513
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:53,972
and I kept driving the bus
with the other, ya know?

514
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:55,572
Then I managed
to open up the door,

515
00:16:55,606 --> 00:16:58,172
and I kicked him out
the door with my foot

516
00:16:58,206 --> 00:16:59,539
at the next stop.

517
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:01,539
You kept making
all the stops?

518
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:09,272
Well, people kept
ringing the bell!

519
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:13,601
Well, what
about the toe?

520
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:14,739
Well, what
about the toe?

521
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:15,906
What happened
to the toe?

522
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:17,906
Well, I am happy to say

523
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,572
the little guy's back in place
at the end of the line.

524
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:26,906
You did all this
for a pinkie toe?

525
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,272
Well, it's a
valuable appendage.

526
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:35,306
So Kramer
found the toe,

527
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:37,239
and they
reattached it.

528
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:38,739
Really?

529
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:41,206
Yeah. Poor kid.
What an ordeal.

530
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:43,601
Right. And you know how
extremely sensitive she is.

531
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:43,872
Right. And you know how
extremely sensitive she is.

532
00:17:44,382 --> 00:17:46,048
She's gonna need
our full support.

533
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:47,715
Yeah, right.

534
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:48,882
Look who's here!

535
00:17:48,915 --> 00:17:50,648
Toby.
Hey, it's Toby.

536
00:17:50,682 --> 00:17:53,315
WOMAN:
How are you? How are you feeling?

537
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:55,115
Oh, I'll be okay.

538
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:56,115
WOMAN:
Are you sure?

539
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:57,282
I think so.

540
00:17:57,315 --> 00:18:00,115
Toby, what can I do?
Can I get you something?

541
00:18:00,148 --> 00:18:02,048
Oh, no. No, thank you.

542
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,015
Toby, please let us help.
We're family.

543
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:07,182
Oh, well, I could
use a cup of coffee.

544
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:09,682
JERRY:
She got the promotion?

545
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:11,048
Yep.

546
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:12,048
Why?

547
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:13,182
I'll tell you why.

548
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:13,601
Because of her pinkie toe.
That's why.

549
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:16,448
Because of her pinkie toe.
That's why.

550
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:18,315
Because Lippman felt
so sorry for her,

551
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,515
he didn't wanna
hurt her feelings.

552
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:21,515
Too bad.

553
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:23,482
Sure, the pinkie toe
is cute,

554
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:25,282
but I mean,
what is it?

555
00:18:25,315 --> 00:18:27,848
It's useless.
It does nothing.

556
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:31,115
It's got that little nail
that's just impossible to cut.

557
00:18:31,148 --> 00:18:32,182
What do we need it for?

558
00:18:32,215 --> 00:18:33,282
Because that's the one

559
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:35,082
that goes "wee wee wee"
all the way home.

560
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,348
You just shut the--

561
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,048
Hey, Elaine.
Did you hear the good news?

562
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:40,315
Toby got promoted.

563
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:41,648
Yes, I heard,
Kramer.

564
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:43,601
I work there,
remember?

565
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:43,682
I work there,
remember?

566
00:18:43,715 --> 00:18:45,182
Yeah, and you know
what she told me?

567
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:46,782
She said her first
order of business

568
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:48,848
is to put my coffee table book
into the bookstores

569
00:18:48,882 --> 00:18:50,682
as soon as possible.

570
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:52,482
Oh, wonderful!

571
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:55,548
You know, throughout this whole
thing, she always kept smiling.

572
00:18:55,582 --> 00:18:58,248
Of course. She's deranged.

573
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:01,882
I went down
to the magazine.

574
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:03,682
I pleaded with him
to come see me again.

575
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:06,615
He's coming tonight
and writing another article.

576
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:09,048
I heard you went down
to somebody's office

577
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:10,482
and heckled them?

578
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:13,115
Damn right. We've been
lap dogs long enough.

579
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:13,601
How could you do that?
Everybody's talking about it.

580
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:15,782
How could you do that?
Everybody's talking about it.

581
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:18,448
It's about time one of us
drew a line in the sand.

582
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:19,448
Jerry,

583
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:21,182
you're like Rosa Parks.

584
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:24,948
You opened the door
for all of us.

585
00:19:24,982 --> 00:19:27,315
I can't wait till the next time
somebody heckles me.

586
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:28,982
Yeah, well,
it won't be long.

587
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:31,982
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jerry Seinfeld!

588
00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:37,048
Robin? Robin!

589
00:19:38,315 --> 00:19:39,982
George, what is it?
I'm working.

590
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:40,982
Robin, listen to me.

591
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:43,148
The most amazing
thing has happened.

592
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:43,601
Kramer has
opened my eyes.

593
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:46,115
Kramer has
opened my eyes.

594
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:47,482
I think
I've changed.

595
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:50,382
What are you
talking about? Okay.

596
00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:52,715
I mean, Bozo the Clown.

597
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:56,382
I mean, does he really need
"the Clown" in his title

598
00:19:56,415 --> 00:19:58,615
as clown.
Bozo the Clown?

599
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:02,315
Are we gonna confuse him
with Bozo the district attorney?

600
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:05,382
Bozo the pope?
There's no other Bozo.

601
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:07,715
You'll see. Things
will be different now

602
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,048
if you'll just give me
one more chance.

603
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:13,601
L-listen, I-I gotta
think about this.

604
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:14,015
L-listen, I-I gotta
think about this.

605
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:16,448
All right, but I'm
serious about this.

606
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,748
All right.
Hand it over, man!

607
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:22,548
That's why men hunt
and women nest.

608
00:20:22,582 --> 00:20:23,715
GEORGE:
He's got a gun!

609
00:20:23,748 --> 00:20:26,515
He's got a gun!
Get out of the way!

610
00:20:26,548 --> 00:20:28,548
[SCREAMING]

611
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:36,682
George!

612
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:39,482
This is Ronnie Kaye!

613
00:20:39,515 --> 00:20:40,648
The prop comic?

614
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:43,601
Oh, hi. I--

615
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:44,315
Oh, hi. I--

616
00:20:44,348 --> 00:20:45,348
I didn't
recognize you.

617
00:20:45,382 --> 00:20:47,548
What, did you...
You get a haircut?

618
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:48,582
Nostrils.

619
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:52,648
George,

620
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:53,982
could I have a word?

621
00:20:54,015 --> 00:20:56,015
[♪]

622
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:04,882
I was in a hotel the other day,

623
00:21:04,882 --> 00:21:07,415
and they have that fire map
on the back of the door.

624
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:09,582
I'm flattered they think
I have it together enough

625
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:12,182
to stand in a burning hotel
room memorizing directions.

626
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:13,848
"Hey, I'll go left
by the stair,

627
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:16,348
right by the candy machine."

628
00:21:16,382 --> 00:21:18,482
I'd probably get lost,
have to go back to the room,

629
00:21:18,515 --> 00:21:19,882
check the map again.

630
00:21:21,415 --> 00:21:23,715
And they always tell you,
no matter what you do,

631
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:26,382
in a hotel fire,
do not panic.

632
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:27,948
Hey, I've got
four minutes to live.

633
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:29,515
I've never panicked
in my whole life.

634
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:31,715
It's my option.

635
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,011
Even if they find you,
you have a perfect excuse.

636
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:34,182
Even if they find you,
you have a perfect excuse.

637
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:36,815
"Gee, I heard they saved you
swinging from the shower curtain

638
00:21:36,848 --> 00:21:40,148
naked with the ice bucket
on your head. What happened?"

639
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:41,148
"Well, I panicked."

640
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:42,848
"That's understandable."
