00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:02,369
What are lawyers, really?

2
00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:04,305
To me, a lawyer is basically

3
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:07,842
the person that knows
the rules of the country.

4
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,145
We're all throwing the dice,
playing the game,

5
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:11,680
moving our pieces
around the board,

6
00:00:11,714 --> 00:00:14,517
but if there's a problem,
the lawyer is the only person

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,187
that has read the inside
of the top of the box.

8
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:20,023
I think one of the fun things
for them

9
00:00:20,056 --> 00:00:21,025
is to say, "objection."

10
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:22,492
"Objection!

11
00:00:22,526 --> 00:00:26,597
Objection, Your Honor."

12
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:29,367
"Objection," of course,
is the adult version of...

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,000
"afraid not."

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,337
"afraid not."

To which the judge
can say two things.

17
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:39,446
He can say, "Overruled,"

18
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,617
which is the adult version
of "afraid so."

19
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:44,952
or he can say, "Sustained,"

20
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:47,321
which is the adult version
of "duh!"

21
00:00:53,395 --> 00:00:56,699
So uh...
So you're a lawyer?

22
00:00:56,732 --> 00:00:58,201
What kind of cases
do you handle?

23
00:00:58,234 --> 00:01:00,871
Oh, everything:
divorce, patents,

24
00:01:00,904 --> 00:01:02,206

and naturalization.

on the mound.

359
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:14,253
Well,
the next pitch,

360
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:16,123
he's right back
in the same place.

361
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:19,216
So I had to plunk him.

362
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:19,494
So I had to plunk him.

363
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:21,662
You plunked him?

364
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:22,663
Oh, yeah.

365
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:23,865
Well, he throws down his bat,

366
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:25,534
he comes racing up to the mound.

367
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,037
Next thing, both benches
are cleared, you know?

368
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,205
A brouhaha breaks out

369
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:30,773
between the guys in the camp,
you know,

370
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:32,208
and the old Yankee players,

371
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:33,810
and as I'm trying to get
Moose Skowron

372
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:35,445
off of one of my teammates,
you know,

373
00:11:35,478 --> 00:11:37,280
somebody pulls me from behind,
you know,

374
00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:40,118
and I turned around,
and I popped him.

375
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:43,154
I looked down, and whoa, man,
it's Mickey!

376
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:46,458
I punched his lights out.

377
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:48,327
Wow,
this is incredible.

378
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,216
BABU:
Leave me alone!

379
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:49,562
BABU:
Leave me alone!

380
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:51,998
You can't do this
to me.

381
00:11:52,032 --> 00:11:54,300
What's going on out there?
BABU: What are you doing?

382
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:55,802
This is not right,
people.

383
00:11:55,836 --> 00:11:58,305
You're making a bad
mistake, very bad.

384
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,341
Babu!
I'll be right back.

385
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:01,509
Yeah, so?

386
00:12:01,543 --> 00:12:03,077
Then Hank Bauer, you know,
he's screaming,

387
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,079
"Mickey, Mickey!

388
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:05,213
"What have you done with Mickey?

389
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,883
You killed Mickey!"

390
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:08,917
So, what'd you do?

391
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:11,721
Well, I got the hell
out of there.

392
00:12:11,755 --> 00:12:13,823
They took Babu away.

393
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:15,559
They took Babu away?

394
00:12:15,592 --> 00:12:18,563
Yeah, the immigration guy
said his visa was expired.

395
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:19,216
Poor Babu.

396
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:19,564
Poor Babu.

397
00:12:19,597 --> 00:12:20,931
Everything was going so well
for him.

398
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:23,001
He had an apartment.
He had a job.

399
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,002
What a shame.

400
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,437
BABU:
Jerry!

401
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:28,774
Help me!

402
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:31,243
I will, Babu!

403
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:32,579
I will help you,
Babu!

404
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:34,447
Don't worry!

405
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:36,116
Then Hank Bauer,
you know,

406
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:37,585
he's chasing me around.

407
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:40,588
He trips over third base
and knocks over Clete Boyer.

408
00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:41,756
Uh-oh.

409
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,592
What?

410
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,693
Well,
this is interesting.

411
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,295
What is that?

412
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:48,564
It's a letter
from the immigration bureau.

413
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:49,216
It's Babu's visa renewal
application form.

414
00:12:49,216 --> 00:12:53,970
It's Babu's visa renewal
application form.

415
00:12:54,004 --> 00:12:56,240
They must've put it
in my mailbox by mistake.

416
00:12:56,273 --> 00:12:58,943
Well, doesn't he need that?

417
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:09,956
If you had given me my mail
last week,

418
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,257
this whole thing
never would've happened.

419
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,427
You should've come
to my house to pick it up.

420
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,794
Yeah, so am I
being funny now?

421
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,496
No, actually,
you're not being funny now.

422
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,500
Yeah, see, I told you
I wasn't funny all the time.

423
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:21,469
Hey, George, look.
I'm not funny now.

424
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:22,603
No, and you weren't funny

425
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:23,939
last night either.

426
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:25,674
In fact, you got us both
so depressed

427
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:27,643
she asked me to drive
her home after dinner.

428
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:29,912
Well, look, I need to get
in touch with Cheryl.

429
00:13:29,946 --> 00:13:31,914
Babu needs a lawyer.
His visa's expired.

430
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:33,917
What do you need her for?
There's a million lawyers.

431
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:34,117
You said this is one of the
things that her firm does.

432
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:36,754
You said this is one of the
things that her firm does.

433
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:39,757
All right, all right,
but no funny business.

434
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,759
Same deal
as last night.

435
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:42,093
Oh,
will you stop it already?

436
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:43,094
Jerry, please.

437
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:44,463
How long is this gonna go on?

438
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:46,631
Till I'm comfortable.

439
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:48,801
Well, when is
that gonna be?

440
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:50,936
After consummation.

441
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,473
Consummation?

442
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:56,310
I don't think you have
enough material.

443
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:01,783
I actually have
a friend

444
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:02,950

department

00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:04,117

a big favor.

a big favor.

447
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:06,054
You're very lucky.

00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:14,398
Thank you.

You're a very serious person,
aren't you?

00:14:19,003 --> 00:14:20,738
Well, so many people

deprived and unhappy...

453
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:24,309
Doesn't seem
like it would be fair

454
00:14:24,342 --> 00:14:25,511
to be...cheerful.

455
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,117
I understand.

00:14:34,117 --> 00:14:35,088
I understand.

457
00:14:35,122 --> 00:14:37,090
I think
that's curdled.

458
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:39,027
I don't care.

459
00:14:41,395 --> 00:14:44,433
Do you ever laugh?

460
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,102
Not really.

when I'm in the tub.

462
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:52,943

00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:56,480
I'm a comedian.

Oh, let me get that.

466
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:02,053
You've been
so helpful.

Hey, we're gonna
go see Babu now, right?

Hi.

Listen, gosh,
I wanted to thank you so much

473
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,973
for convincing Ping
to drop the case.

Well, you know, after we met,
you were all so nice,

00:15:21,242 --> 00:15:23,111
I just couldn't go through
with it...

476
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:24,312
but between you and me,

477
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:25,514
you would've paid
through the nose.

I never got my visa renewal form
in the mail.
