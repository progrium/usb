1
00:00:01,433 --> 00:00:03,200
Do you think

2
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:05,800
that the people at the airport
that run the stores

3
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:07,633
have any idea
what the prices are

4
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:09,833
everyplace else in the world,

5
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:11,400
or do you think they just feel

6
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:13,333
they have their own
little country out there

7
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:15,300
and they can charge
anything they want?

8
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,633
"You hungry?
Tuna sandwich is $9.00.

9
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,166
"You don't like it,

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,833
go back to your own country."

11
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:23,300
I think the whole
airport/airline complex

12
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,200
is a huge scam

13
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,866
just to sell
the tuna sandwiches.

14
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,366
I think that profit

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,000
is what's supporting
the whole air travel industry.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,366
is what's supporting
the whole air travel industry.

17
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,900
I mean, think about it.

18
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,400
The terminals, the airplanes.

19
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:35,900
It's all just a distraction

20
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:38,400
so that you don't notice
the beating that you're taking

21
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:39,600
on the tuna.

22
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,133
It's all departures.

23
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,733
I see nothing but departures.

24
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:50,566
Do you know
where the arrivals are?

25
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Uh, excuse me, sir.
Do you have the time?

26
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:58,133
There's a clock over there.

27
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,733
Where?

28
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:01,566
Over there.

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,866
But you have
a watch on.

30
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,666
It's right by the escalator.

31
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,833
Why don't you just
look at your watch?

32
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:10,499
I told you,
it's right over there.

33
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:11,833
I told you,
it's right over there.

34
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:13,033
Let me see the watch.

35
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:14,133
Hey!

36
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,966
What are you,
some kind of nut?

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,566
You know,
we're living in a society!

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,633
George.

39
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,033
Jerry, Jerry.

40
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:25,200
I'm sorry.
The flight was delayed.

41
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:26,400
How long have you
been waiting?

42
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:27,566
I just got here.

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,500
My car broke down
on the Belt Parkway.

44
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:32,066
I can't believe-- Why don't you
get rid of that piece of junk?

45
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,700
One mile from the exit,
it starts shaking,

46
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:34,733
really violently shaking,

47
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:36,533
like it's having
a nervous breakdown,

48
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:38,166
then it completely stopped dead.

49
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,700
So you have no car.

50
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:40,499
No.

51
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:40,866
No.

52
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,100
So, what good are you?

53
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,500
I'll tell you one thing.

54
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,066
This chauffeur's going to
be waiting a while.

55
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,066
O'Brien's not showing up.
How do you know?

56
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,200
He was in Chicago.
The flight was overbooked.

57
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:52,633
They wouldn't let him
on the plane.

58
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,066
He kept screaming how he had
to get to Madison Square Garden.

59
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,033
We should take his limo.

60
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:58,533
Yeah, right.

61
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:03,000
Wait a second.

62
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,400
Think about it.

63
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,533
He's not showing up.

64
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:08,333
Wait'll you see
the line for cabs.

65
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,133
It's, like,
45 minutes long.

66
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:10,499
You said
he's in Chicago.

67
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:11,566
You said
he's in Chicago.

68
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,166
He's definitely in Chicago.

69
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,566
Well, that guy
is just standing there.

70
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,533
How would we do it?

71
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:21,533
We just go up to him,
we say, "We're O'Brien."

72
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,400
Maybe he knows O'Brien.

73
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:25,833
No, he doesn't know
O'Brien.

74
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:28,666
If he knew O'Brien,
he wouldn't have a sign.

75
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,333
Let's just do it.

76
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:31,533
Well, what if we get caught?

77
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:32,633
What's going to happen?

78
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,300
They can't kill us.

79
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,633
Who's going to be O'Brien?

80
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,800
I'll be O'Brien.

81
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,333
Who am I?

82
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:40,499
You're you.

83
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:42,000
You're you.

84
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:43,000
Just me?

85
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah.

86
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,733
Okay.

87
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,466
What, you don't want
to be you?

88
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,833
Well, if you're
going to be O'Brien,

89
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:50,533
why can't I be somebody?

90
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,166
Like who?

91
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,966
Dylan Murphy.

92
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,566
Okay.

93
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,633
What, now you want
to be Dylan Murphy?

94
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,133
Well, I like Dylan.

95
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,700
You could be Colin.

96
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,366
Okay. Colin O'Brien.

97
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,833
I'm Dylan Murphy.
I'm Colin O'Brien.

98
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,499
Are we really doing this?

99
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:10,900
Are we really doing this?

100
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,300
Come on.

101
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,500
Hey, do you have
the time?

102
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,300
Clock over there.

103
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,866
O'Brien.

104
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes, sir.

105
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:20,000
Sorry we're, uh...
we're late.

106
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,400
Here, let me take that for you.

107
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:22,400
Oh, thank you.
Uh...

108
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,566
I'll get the car

109
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,733
and I'll bring it
around front.

110
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:26,300
Thank you very much.

111
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,400
Dylan.

112
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:29,733
Colin.

113
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,533
Can you believe this?

114
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:35,133
This is incredible.

115
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,566
This is one of
the greatest things

116
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,166
I've ever done
in my life.

117
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,400
I'm going to call
my mother.

118
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,499
What for?

119
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:40,733
What for?

120
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,500
To tell her
I'm in a limo.

121
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:45,733
Hello, Ma?

122
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:46,966
It's me.

123
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,400
Guess where I am.

124
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:50,200
In the back of a limo.

125
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:52,000
No, nobody died.

126
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,900
It's a long story.

127
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,566
I can't tell you now.

128
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,133
Because I can't.

129
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,800
I said I can't.

130
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,866
If I could, I would.

131
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,200
Would you stop it?

132
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:05,366
All right, look--

133
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,833
I'm-- I'm getting off.

134
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:08,300
No, I'm not telling you.

135
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,500
How's this?
I'm never telling you.

136
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:10,499
I don't care. No!

137
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:11,166
I don't care. No!

138
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,400
Fine! Never!

139
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:17,733
She happy for you?

140
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:21,500
Can he hear us?

141
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:22,500
Mm-mm.

142
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:23,700
Why?

143
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,000
Thought I saw him

144
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:26,366
look in the mirror
suspiciously.

145
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,966
He can't hear us.

146
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,400
Let's test him.

147
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:32,366
Hey, driver!

148
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,000
What do you say
we, uh, stop off,

149
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:35,000
pick up your sister,

150
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:36,933
have a little fun
back here?

151
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,499
No. He can't hear us.

152
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:41,000
No. He can't hear us.

153
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:42,133
Where's he dropping us?

154
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,700
Maybe we can get him
to drop us

155
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:44,700
right at my house.

156
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:46,266
I'll ask him.

157
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:49,966
Uh, my dear fellow,

158
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,466
where are you
dropping us?

159
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,166
At Madison Square Garden,
of course.

160
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,333
I have the four passes.

161
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:55,466
Of course.

162
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,533
The, uh...
the four passes.

163
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,366
Four passes? Four passes
to Madison Square Garden?

164
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,333
Wait a minute.

165
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:07,000
Wait a minute.
Of course.

166
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:08,566
Chicago.

167
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,499
The Knicks are playing
the Bulls tonight.

168
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:11,000
The Knicks are playing
the Bulls tonight.

169
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:12,033
What?

170
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:13,833
We are going
to the Knick game!

171
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:15,333
Michael Jordan!
The Knicks!

172
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:17,633
We're going
to the Knick game!

173
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,833
Four free passes!

174
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:20,466
Did I tell you?
Did I tell you?

175
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,300
I can't believe it!

176
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,700
You may have hit with this one.

177
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:24,700
Oh, you see?

178
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:25,900
You see?

179
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:28,633
I see things as they are,
and I say, "No."

180
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:29,966
Uh, wait.

181
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,800
Uh, you see things
as they are not,

182
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,466
and you say--

183
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,133
Wait. Uh...
You see thi--

184
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,533
You see things
