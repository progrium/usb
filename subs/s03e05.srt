1
00:00:01,166 --> 00:00:04,666
Does it seem to you
that the ventriloquist dummy

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,900
has a very active
sexual-social life?

3
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:11,466
He's always talking about dates
and women that he knows

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,966
and bringing them back
to the suitcase at night.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,133
There's always a sawdust joke
in there somewhere, you know.

6
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:20,633
He says kinky things

7
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:23,500
because he's made out of wood
and he can spin his head around.

8
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:25,166
We're somehow
expected to believe,

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,833
Because the face is so animated,

10
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:30,000
that they think
we're not noticing

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,733
that they think
we're not noticing

12
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,133
that the feet
are just swinging there.

13
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,333
Dummy feet

14
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:35,700
never look really right,
do they?

15
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:36,900
They're just
kind of dangling there.

16
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:38,300
They're always kind of askew,

17
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,400
you know?

18
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:41,033
And you always just see
a little ankle,

19
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:42,700
those little, thin,
fabric ankles that they have,

20
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:44,000
you know.

21
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:47,000
You think, "I don't think
this thing is real."

22
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:52,400
Are you kidding me?

23
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:54,466
Let me speak
with the head librarian.

24
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,700
Because it's absurd!

25
00:00:56,733 --> 00:01:00,800
An overdue book from 1971?

26
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,733
This is a joke, right?

27
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:04,300
What, are you
from a radio station?

28
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,700
Okay, you got me.
I fell for it.

29
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:10,733
All right. Okay.

30
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:12,533
I can be down there
in, like, a half-hour.

31
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:13,966
Bye.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,566
What's the problem?

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,033
This you're not
going to believe.

34
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:18,131
The New York
Public Library...

35
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:18,300
The New York
Public Library...

36
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,800
Uh-huh.

37
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:24,733
says that I took out
<i>Tropic of Cancer</i> in 1971

38
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:26,400
and never returned it.

39
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:29,400
Do you know
how much that comes to?

40
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:31,900
That's a nickel a day
for 20 years.

41
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:33,400
It's going to be $50,000.

42
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:34,900
It doesn't work
like that.

43
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:37,066
If it's a dime a day,
it could be 100,000.

44
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,300
It's not going to be
anything.

45
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:39,466
I returned the book.

46
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,400
I remember it
very vividly,

47
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:42,566
because I was
with Sherry Becker.

48
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,800
Mm-hmm.
She wore
this orange dress.

49
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:45,866
It was the first time

50
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,666
I ever saw her
in a dress like that.

51
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,131
I'd known her since ninth grade,

52
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:48,866
I'd known her since ninth grade,

53
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,466
and she was developing this body
in secret,

54
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,233
under these loose clothes,
for, like, two years,

55
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:54,066
and then one day...

56
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,633
<i>this orange dress.</i>

57
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,966
It's burned in my memory.

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,700
Ooh. Memory burn, huh?

59
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:04,300
I wonder
whatever happened to her.

60
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,533
How did they find you?

61
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:06,900
Oh, computers.

62
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:09,566
They're cracking down now
on overdue books.

63
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,566
The whole thing's
completely ridiculous.

64
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,733
[INTERCOM BUZZES]

65
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:13,733
That's George.

66
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:14,733
Wait'll he finds out

67
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:15,733
we're going
to the library

68
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:17,066
He'll be thrilled.
Uh-huh.

69
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,131
You know, I never got
a library card.

70
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:18,666
You know, I never got
a library card.

71
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,033
I'm coming down.

72
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,633
It's all a bunch
of cheapskates

73
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,033
in there anyway.

74
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:24,200
People sitting around,

75
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:25,400
reading the newspaper

76
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:27,400
attached to those
huge wooden sticks.

77
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:29,066
Trying to save a quarter.

78
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,300
Ooh.

79
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,733
I got to go
to the library.

80
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:33,400
You want to go?

81
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,366
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

82
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:46,566
The Dewey Decimal System.

83
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,800
What a scam that was.

84
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,131
Boy, this Dewey guy

85
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:49,833
Boy, this Dewey guy

86
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:52,400
really cleaned up
on that deal.

87
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:54,166
Where's George?

88
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,533
Shh!

89
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:56,700
Look.

90
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:57,833
Trying to save
a quarter.

91
00:02:57,866 --> 00:02:59,833
I kind of like
those sticks.

92
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:02,900
I'd like to get them
in my house.

93
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:10,900
This woman's
completely ignoring me.

94
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,400
Look at her.

95
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:15,433
This is a lonely woman
looking for companionship.

96
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:18,131
A spinster.

97
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,733
A spinster.

98
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,866
Maybe a virgin.

99
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,900
Maybe she got hurt
a long time ago.

100
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:28,733
She's a schoolgirl.
There was a boy.

101
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:29,900
It didn't work out,

102
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:32,400
so now she needs
a little tenderness.

103
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:34,900
She needs
a little understanding.

104
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:37,600
Needs a little Kramer.

105
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,366
Then she'll need

106
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,966
a little shot
of penicillin.

107
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,500
Yes?

108
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:47,733
Yeah, I called before.

109
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:48,131
I got this notice
in the mail.

110
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:49,866
I got this notice
in the mail.

111
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,333
Oh, <i>Tropic of Cancer.</i>

112
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,833
Henry Miller.

113
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:58,333
Uh, this case
has been turned over

114
00:03:58,366 --> 00:03:59,533
to our Library Investigations
officer,

115
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:00,633
Mr. Bookman.

116
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,066
Bookman?

117
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,066
The library investigator's name
is actually Bookman?

118
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,200
Come on.

119
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:07,200
It's true.

120
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:08,400
That's amazing.

121
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:11,833
That's like an ice cream man
named Cone.

122
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:13,900
Well, Lieutenant Bookman's
been working here for 25 years,

123
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,033
so I think he's heard
all the jokes.

124
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:17,833
Can I speak
with this Bookman?

125
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:18,131
Just a second.

126
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:18,900
Just a second.

127
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,000
Jerry...

128
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:24,900
Jerry...

129
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,400
What?

130
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,833
I think I saw him.
I think it's him.

131
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:30,866
Who?

132
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,066
Did you see
the homeless guy

133
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,366
on the library steps

134
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
screaming obscenities

135
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:35,833
and doing some sort
of calisthenics routine?

136
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:37,033
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.

137
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:38,200
I think that's Mr. Heyman.

138
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:41,333
The gym teacher
from our high school.

139
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:44,200
Shh!

140
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:45,533
Heyman? Are you sure?

141
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:46,533
He's older.

142
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:48,131
Completely covered
in filth.

143
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:48,900
Completely covered
in filth.

144
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:52,000
No whistle,
but I think it's him.

145
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:53,833
George got him fired.

146
00:04:53,866 --> 00:04:55,833
He squealed on him.

147
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:57,233
Ooh. Tattletale.

148
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:58,233
I didn't tattle.

149
00:04:58,266 --> 00:04:59,500
Shh!

150
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,700
All right.

151
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,566
Well, what did this guy do?
What happened?

152
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,800
There was an incident.

153
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,400
I'd rather not
discuss it.

154
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:06,800
Oh, come on. You can tell me.

155
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:07,900
Some other time.

156
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,066
What, tonight?

157
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,733
You know, I never figured you
for a squealer.

158
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:14,566
Oh, he sang
like a canary.

159
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,733
Mr. Bookman's not here.

160
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:18,131
Not here? Why was I told
to come down here?

161
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:18,200
Not here? Why was I told
to come down here?

162
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:20,566
He'll be out all afternoon
on a case.

163
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,733
He's out on a case?

164
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:23,166
He actually goes out cases?

165
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,066
Well, what am I
supposed to do now?

166
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,866
I'll have Mr. Bookman
get in touch with you.

167
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,400
All right. Thanks.

168
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:30,400
Come on, let's go.

169
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:32,400
Let's go see
if it's Heyman.

170
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:33,566
It's not him.

171
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,566
Hey, I'll, uh...

172
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,933
I'll see you boys later, huh?

173
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,400
So, uh, what's a guy
got to do around here

174
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:45,433
to get a library card?

175
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,833
Where's Karen?

176
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:01,233
She went
to pick up lunch.

177
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:02,366
Well,

178
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,800
she didn't ask me what I wanted.

179
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:08,133
She must have forgot.

180
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,733
How could she forget?

181
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:11,200
I've been ordering lunch here

182
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,066
every day
for three and a half years.

183
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:16,800
Is there something
you're not telling me?

184
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,131
Because I'm getting, like,
a really weird vibe.

185
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:18,366
Because I'm getting, like,
a really weird vibe.

186
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:20,900
Is Lippman getting rid of me?

187
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,133
It's okay. You can tell me.

188
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,133
I won't say anything.

189
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,566
I don't know anything.

190
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,900
Aha!

191
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:27,466
You don't know anything.
You see?

192
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,466
"I don't know anything" means
that there's something to know.

193
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,800
If you really
didn't know anything,

194
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,233
you would have said,
"You're crazy."

195
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,066
Oh, hi, Mr. Lippman.

196
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,366
Elaine.

197
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,033
Um, I was wondering
if you got a chance

198
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,400
to look at that
biography of Columbus

199
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:43,333
that I gave you.

200
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,400
Yes, I did.

201
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:48,131
Yes, I did.

202
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:49,666
Yes, I did.

203
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,333
Marie, this water
is still too cold.

204
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:52,500
Oh, yeah.

205
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:53,533
It's freezing!

206
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,833
Hurts your teeth.

207
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:05,133
I'm telling you,
something is going on.

208
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,000
He never likes
anything I recommend,

209
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,500
and then
that lunch thing.

210
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:10,366
So they forgot
to get your lunch.

211
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,500
Big deal.

212
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:12,566
What do you know?

213
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,500
You've never worked
in an office.

214
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,166
See, you've worked
in an office, George.

215
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,800
You understand.

216
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,131
Jerry thinks
I'm overreacting,

217
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:18,833
Jerry thinks
I'm overreacting,

218
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:20,566
but you understand.
Lunch.

219
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,833
I don't understand lunch.

220
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:23,566
I don't know anything
about lunch.

221
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,166
Just because
I got the guy fired

222
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,633
doesn't mean I turned him
into a bum, does it?

223
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:28,666
What did he do?

224
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,666
He purposely
mispronounced my name.

225
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,000
Instead of saying "Costanza",

226
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:35,333
he'd say, "Can't-stand-ya!

227
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:36,866
Can't-stand-ya!"

228
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,000
Remember he made me smell
my own gym socks once?

229
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:44,166
I remember, he made you wear
a jock on your head

230
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,533
for a whole class,

231
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,533
and the straps
were hanging down.

232
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:48,131
Okay, okay.

233
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:48,666
Okay, okay.

234
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,000
You never even
had him for gym.

235
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:53,566
I had him for hygiene.
Remember his teeth?

236
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,000
It was like
from an exhumed corpse.

237
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:57,666
Like little baked beans.

238
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,666
Ew.

239
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,700
Yuck.

240
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:03,500
Come on, tell me
what happened.

241
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, okay.

242
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:09,000
As I said,
the guy had it in for me.

243
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:10,566
He actually failed me in gym.

244
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,633
Me.

245
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:16,233
<i>And those</i>
<i>spastic Schnitzer twins.</i>

246
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:17,333
Can't-stand-ya!

247
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:18,131
Yes, Mr. Heyman?

248
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:18,400
Yes, Mr. Heyman?

249
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:19,500
Your underwear

250
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,666
was sticking out
of your shorts

251
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,666
during gym class.

252
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,833
Oh, well,

253
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:24,400
I guess that's because
I wear boxer shorts.

254
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:27,166
Boxer shorts, huh?
What brand?

255
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,666
I'm not really sure. I--

256
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,866
Yeah, well,
let's take a look!

257
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,000
[LAUGHS MANIACALLY]

258
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:32,066
[SCREAMS]

259
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,833
<i>He gave me a wedgie.</i>

260
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:36,366
And he got fired the next day.

261
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,033
Why do they call it
a wedgie?

262
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:39,966
Because the underwear
is pulled up from the back

263
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,300
until it...

264
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,600
wedges in.

265
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:47,000
They also have an atomic wedgie.

266
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:48,131
Now, the goal there

267
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:48,500
Now, the goal there

268
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:53,733
is to actually get the waistband
on top of the head.

269
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,400
It's very rare.

270
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:57,900
Boys are sick.

271
00:08:57,933 --> 00:08:59,800
Well, what do girls do?

272
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,900
We just tease someone

273
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:04,666
till they develop
an eating disorder.

274
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,500
I got to go back to the library
and talk to him.

275
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:10,166
I got to find out
if I ruined his life.

276
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,366
Hey, Babaloo,

277
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,566
you better get home.

278
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,166
You know, this guy Bookman
from the library,

279
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,166
he's waiting for you.

280
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,033
What's amazing to me
about the library,

281
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:18,131
is that here's a place
where you can go in,

282
00:09:18,131 --> 00:09:20,033
is that here's a place
where you can go in,

283
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:22,000
you take out any book you want,

284
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,500
and they just give it to you

285
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:25,333
and say, "Bring it back
when you're done."

286
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:26,733
Reminds you of, like,
this pathetic friend

287
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,500
everybody had
when they were a little kid

288
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,500
that would let you borrow
any of his stuff

289
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:32,300
if you would just be his friend,
you know?

290
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,366
That's what the library is.

291
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,300
It's a government-funded
pathetic friend,

292
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,066
and that's why everybody
kind of bullies the library.

293
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,300
I'll bring it back on time,
I'll bring it back late.

294
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,866
Oh, what are you going to do?
What are you going to do?

295
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,866
You gonna charge me,
a nickel?

296
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,333
Well, I'm glad
you're here.

297
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,131
We'll get this straightened out.
Would you like a cup of tea?

298
00:09:48,131 --> 00:09:48,700
We'll get this straightened out.
Would you like a cup of tea?

299
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:49,700
You got any coffee?

300
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:50,700
Coffee?
Yeah, coffee.

301
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:51,833
No, I don't drink coffee.

302
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:52,833
You don't drink coffee?

303
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:53,833
How about instant coffee?

304
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:54,900
No, I don't have--

305
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:56,333
You don't have
any instant coffee?

306
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:58,000
Well, I don't--
Who doesn't have instant coffee?

307
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:59,166
I don't.

308
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,533
You buy a jar
of Folger's crystals,

309
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,533
you put it in the cupboard,
you forget about it,

310
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:04,333
and later on, when you need it,
it's there.

311
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:05,333
It lasts forever.

312
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:06,333
It's freeze-dried crystals.

313
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:07,500
Freeze-dried crystals.

314
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:10,900
Really.
I'll have to remember that.

315
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,000
You took this book out
in 1971.

316
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:14,633
Yes, and I returned it
in 1971.

317
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,666
Yeah, '71.

318
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,500
That was my first year
on the job.

319
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,131
Bad year for libraries.

320
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:19,000
Bad year for libraries.

321
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:20,333
Bad year for America.

322
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:22,500
Hippies burning library cards.

323
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:25,833
Abbie Hoffman telling everybody
to steal books.

324
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't judge a man
by the length of his hair

325
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:29,633
or the kind of music
he listens to.

326
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,200
Rock was never my bag.
But you put on a pair of shoes

327
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,200
when you walk into the New York
Public Library, fella.

328
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,000
Look, Mr. Bookman...

329
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,500
I returned that book.

330
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:40,333
I remember it very specifically.

331
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:42,566
You're a comedian.
You make people laugh.
I try.

332
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,766
You think this is all
a big joke, don't you?

333
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:48,131
No, I don't.

334
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:48,666
No, I don't.

335
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,000
I saw you on TV once.

336
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:51,366
I remembered your name
from my list.

337
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,366
I looked it up.

338
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Sure enough,
it checked out.

339
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,900
You think because
you're a celebrity

340
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:57,533
that somehow the law
doesn't apply to you?

341
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:58,533
That you're
above the law?

342
00:10:58,566 --> 00:10:59,666
Certainly not.

343
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,500
Well, let me tell you something,
funny boy.

344
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:04,333
You know that little stamp,

345
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:05,900
the one that says
"New York Public Library"?

346
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,500
Well, that may not mean
anything to you,

347
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,900
but that means
a lot to me.

348
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,333
One whole hell of a lot.

349
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:12,500
Sure, go ahead,
laugh if you want to.

350
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:14,000
I've seen your type before.

351
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:17,000
Flashy, making the scene,
flaunting convention.

352
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:18,131
Yeah, I know
what you're thinking.

353
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah, I know
what you're thinking.

354
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:20,900
"Why's this guy
making such a big stink

355
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:22,333
about old library books?"

356
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:25,833
Well, let me give you
