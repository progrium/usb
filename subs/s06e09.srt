1
00:00:01,666 --> 00:00:03,666
I don't even know
what is supposed to be

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,633
so attractive about fur.

3
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:07,566
Why does a man wanna see
a woman in fur?

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,000
Men want women to shave
their legs, shave their armpits,

5
00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:11,400
pluck their eyebrows.

6
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:14,133
And then before we go out,
we dress them up like a bear?

7
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,666
To me the only reason
to wear fur

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,500
would be if you were trying
to sneak up on another animal.

9
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,133
Did you ever see
those tribal hunters

10
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,900
where they wear the fur,
and then they have

11
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:25,333
the other animal's head
on top of their head?

12
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:27,800
You know, I'm sure there's
a moose looking at that going,

13
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,333
"Yeah, that looks real good.

14
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:30,000
"Yeah, I'm gonna turn my back
on this goofball

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,700
"Yeah, I'm gonna turn my back
on this goofball

16
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:33,900
"with the extra head
because there's nothing fishy

17
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,166
"going on there.

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,233
"I'll just keep drinking
from the stream.

19
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:40,666
I've seen a lot of
two-headed tigers with knees."

20
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,666
GEORGE: So I am actually
gonna have a secretary.

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,133
And, I get to do
the interview.

22
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,633
It's incredible.
Six months ago,

23
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,400
you were taking messages
for your mother.

24
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:54,900
Yeah, and now someone's gonna
be taking messages for me.

25
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:57,300
From your mother.

26
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,733
So this woman
you plan on hiring--

27
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:02,400
Is she gonna be
in the spokesmodel category?

28
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:04,700
Sure, I could go
the tomato route.

29
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:07,233
But, uh, I've given this
a lot of thought, Jerry.

30
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:10,066
All that frustration--
I'll never get any work done.

31
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,125
So I'm doing a complete 360.

32
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:12,400
So I'm doing a complete 360.

33
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:14,966
I'm going for total
efficiency and ability.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,966
That's a 180, George.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,333
Whatever.

36
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:19,400
Hi, Willie.

37
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:20,866
Hey, Jerry.

38
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,500
I got this stuff
and my mother's fur for storage.

39
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:24,666
What are you doing with it?

40
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,033
Oh, she keeps it
in my apartment

41
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:27,533
for when she comes
up from Florida.

42
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:28,800
Hi.
Hi.

43
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,733
Hey, Jerry.
You know my wife, Donna.

44
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:32,833
Yeah.
That's why I said hi.

45
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:36,133
Hey, nice jacket.

46
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,666
Thanks.
Hound's tooth.

47
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,566
Whoa, this is a beauty.

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,700
Great cut.

49
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,066
It's probably
very flattering.

50
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,125
Oh, yes. It really
accentuates my bust line.

51
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:45,533
Oh, yes. It really
accentuates my bust line.

52
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:47,866
WOMAN:
Well, I type about 90 words a minute.

53
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,700
I'm completely well-versed
in all the IBM

54
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,233
and Macintosh programs.

55
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:52,400
Well, Miss Coggins,

56
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:54,666
you're obviously qualified
for the job.

57
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,966
You have all the necessary
skills and experience.

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,333
But you're extremely attractive.
You're gorgeous,

59
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:02,800
and looking at you,
I can't even remember my name.

60
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:06,700
So I'm afraid
this is not gonna work out.

61
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:08,133
Thanks for coming.

62
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,133
You're luscious.

63
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,866
You're ravishing.

64
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,125
I would give up red meat just to
get a glimpse of you in a bra.

65
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,966
I would give up red meat just to
get a glimpse of you in a bra.

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,366
I'm terribly sorry.
Terribly sorry.

67
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,466
As you can see,
my references are impeccable.

68
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,633
I think I'd be
a real asset here.

69
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,900
My only concern is,
I do take care of my mother,

70
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:25,166
so will there be many
late nights?

71
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,933
I can't imagine.

72
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,800
Okay, so Barney's
is having this huge sale.

73
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,166
I try this dress on.

74
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,500
Stunning. Stunning.

75
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:37,800
I couldn't take my eyes
off myself.

76
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:38,833
Yeah.

77
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,333
Okay, so then
I put it on at home.

78
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:42,125
Looks like I'm carrying twins.

79
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,466
Looks like I'm carrying twins.

80
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,200
So you're saying store,
hotsy-totsy,

81
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:47,333
home, hotsy-notsy.

82
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:48,666
Yeah. Exactly.

83
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,533
Anyway, I gotta go
over there and return it.

84
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:52,133
I thought we're goin'
to the movies?

85
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,500
All right,
I'll try it on again.

86
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:55,333
You tell me what you think.
All right.

87
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:57,233
Hey, hey.

88
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:58,833
Hey, George.
Hey, Elaine.

89
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:00,733
I am telling you, Jerry.

90
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:03,066
Having a secretary
is incredible.

91
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,166
I don't know why
I didn't have one before.

92
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,333
Because you didn't
have a job?

93
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:09,666
Perhaps.

94
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,966
I walk in,
everything is organized:

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,125
messages, appointments.

96
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,466
messages, appointments.

97
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,866
And I can't tell you
how proud I am of myself

98
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,300
for going with Ada.

99
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,733
A lesser man
would have crumbled.

100
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,133
They would've gone
for the dish

101
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,000
and the sure-fire
sexual harassment suit.

102
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:28,966
It's a little--

103
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,966
All right.

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,366
You answered it
right there.

105
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,166
You got no waist
in that thing.

106
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,633
And your arms
look like something

107
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,233
hanging in
a kosher deli.

108
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,700
I said all right.

109
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,000
Well, what'd you buy it for?

110
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:42,125
Why did I buy it?

111
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,133
Why did I buy it?

112
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,633
Because in the mirror
at Barney's,

113
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,000
I looked fabulous.

114
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:47,866
This woman
who was just walking by

115
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,133
said I looked like Demi Moore
in <i>Indecent Proposal.</i>

116
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,200
How fast was she walking?

117
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:55,566
De-mi?

118
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,066
I thought it was Dem-i.

119
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,700
No, I think it's De-mi.

120
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:01,366
Really?

121
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,733
I never heard of a se-mi
tractor-trailer.

122
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:08,133
Wait a minute.

123
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,700
Wait a minute.
I know what's going on here.

124
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,125
Skinny mirrors.

125
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:12,333
Skinny mirrors.

126
00:04:12,366 --> 00:04:13,333
What?

127
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:14,466
Skinny mirrors.

128
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,833
Barney's has skinny mirrors.

129
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:17,966
They make you look,
like, 10 pounds lighter.

130
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,633
Oh, you're crazy.

131
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,166
Am I?

132
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,466
Do you think
I would have bought this dress

133
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,000
if I looked like this
at Barney's?

134
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,400
You know, I think she may
have something there.

135
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:31,033
Oh! Whoa.

136
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:33,666
What are you
all dressed up for?

137
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,800
I'm returning this dress
to Barney's.

138
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,533
Good idea.

139
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:39,533
Do it tomorrow.
We'll go to the movies.

140
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:40,633
Yeah, yeah,
okay.

141
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,866
Look, if you're going there,

142
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,125
maybe you could pick me up

143
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:42,900
maybe you could pick me up

144
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:44,333
some of this super hydrating--

145
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:47,200
It's a total protection
moisturizer with UVA.

146
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:48,333
Yeah.

147
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:50,400
Moisturizer?
That's girl stuff.

148
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,000
No, no, no. Look.
I'll tell you what.

149
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:53,566
They're having a sale, right?
Yeah?

150
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,466
I'll meet you down there.
We'll have lunch.

151
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,566
Well, we could.

152
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,066
Yeah, we'll get
to know each other.

153
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,366
We never get to spend
any time together.

154
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,766
Oh, sure, we have
our little group here--

155
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,833
And then, assuming
the strike is resolved,

156
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:12,125
on April 14th,
we play the Angels.

157
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:12,666
on April 14th,
we play the Angels.

158
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,533
So let's clear a floor
at the Anaheim Hotel.

159
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,233
Anaheim Hotel.

160
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:18,666
You may wanna reconsider.

161
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,033
I believe they only have
room service until 10 p.m.,

162
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:22,800
and then it's only finger foods.

163
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,766
Ada, you're a wonder.

164
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,333
Okay, now, I projected
some of those figures for you

165
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:32,000
regarding the switch to canola
oil for the stadium popcorn,

166
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:34,566
and surprisingly, it will only
cost a half a cent more per bag,

167
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,400
so it is definitely doable.

168
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:37,833
Ada, I have to tell you.

169
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:40,833
I-- I have never met anybody
so...efficient.

170
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:42,125
Well, thank you.
I'm flattered.

171
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:42,233
Well, thank you.
I'm flattered.

172
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,333
I mean, you're just a marvel
of organization.

173
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:50,800
Well, I'm just doing my job.

174
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,500
It's like I'm--
I'm thinking of something,

175
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:55,666
and you're one

00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,200
So?
Listen.

352
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,500
Do me a favor.
Just call Jerry.

353
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:26,133
Tell him to bring me
some clothes.

354
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,666
Oh, God.

355
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:35,733
Hello, Willie.

356
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:37,300
Hey, Jerry.

357
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,000
You're dropping off?

358
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:43,053
No, but, uh, seen
any good <i>movies</i> lately?

359
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:43,333
No, but, uh, seen
any good <i>movies</i> lately?

360
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:45,200
You came by to ask that?

361
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:46,200
Yeah.

362
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,066
Specifically 9:30 shows.

363
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,000
Seen any good 9:30 shows
at the Paragon, Willie?

364
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:53,233
What are you getting at?

365
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:54,966
I saw you the other night
stepping out

366
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,400
with my hound's tooth jacket.

367
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:59,900
Jerry, that's a breach
of the dry-cleaner's code.

368
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:03,700
You need a code to tell you
not to wear people's clothes?

369
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:06,333
I wasn't wearing
your jacket.

370
00:13:06,366 --> 00:13:09,466
Jerry, your imagining--

371
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,733
Am I imagining this?

372
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,300
Found that little cutie
in the pocket.

373
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,366
Jerry, I--

374
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
Yeah, well, now that we
understand each other,

375
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,133
I'll be taking
my business elsewhere.

376
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,866
And I want my mother's
fur coat back too.

377
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,366
Jerry, come on.

378
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,366
Now.

379
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,666
Now?

380
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:34,400
Yeah, I want that coat.

381
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:35,900
Well, I--

382
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:37,200
Where's the ticket?

383
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,566
Oh, Kramer.

384
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,066
Wait-- Wait a minute.

385
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,000
You mean to tell me
that you don't have a ticket

386
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:43,053
for the coat?

387
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:44,166
for the coat?

388
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,300
No, not on me.

389
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,500
Well, I-- I need to see
that ticket.

390
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:50,500
Why? I got my cleaning
before without a ticket.

391
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:52,333
Yeah, but this is different.

392
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:55,666
Those fur storage
warehouses are huge.

393
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,700
You can't get anything
without a number.

394
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,533
All right.
I'll be back.

395
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,166
Yeah, it looks good here,
but what does that mean?

396
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,066
So, uh, do you want it?

397
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,700
I don't know.
I have to think about it.

398
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,166
I need a non-partisan mirror.

399
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,166
ADA:
I can't thank you enough, Mr. Costanza.

400
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,633
I'm so grateful.

401
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:35,400
Yes, well, I sat down
with Mr. Steinbrenner.

402
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:37,500
I told him you have been
doing great work.

403
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:40,166
I said that you deserved a raise
and if you didn't get it,

404
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,053
that I was leaving.

405
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:43,200
that I was leaving.

406
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:45,133
It was just so generous.

407
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,500
Oh, well, don't worry about it.

408
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:47,633
He's got plenty of money.

409
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,800
Oh, I know.

410
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,866
But 25,000?

411
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:57,233
So you got
a $25,000-a-year raise?

412
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:58,533
Yes.

413
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:00,333
Oh, I tell you.
Mr. Steinbrenner was--

414
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,466
You know, you're--
You're making more than I am.

415
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,633
I am?

416
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,500
A secretary cannot make
more than her boss.

417
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:09,233
Well, apparently they can.

418
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,233
Oh, this is insanity.

419
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:27,033
I'm not this hippy.

420
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:29,366
Hey. Hey, what do you
think of this?

421
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,266
You'll never pull it off.

422
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:34,800
Hey, what's going on in there?

423
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,733
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where I could find,

424
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:39,066
like, women's
moisturizer lotions?

425
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,500
This woman's been in there
for over an hour.

426
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,000
Excuse me, miss.
Is everything okay in there?

427
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:49,033
KRAMER:
Yeah.

428
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:54,566
Kramer?

429
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,000
Jerry.
You got my clothes?

430
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:58,500
What clothes?

431
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:00,300
Didn't Elaine
call you?

432
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,366
No.

433
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,200
Well, what are you
doing here?

434
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:04,966
What am I doing here?

435
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,900
You're in the women's
dressing room.

436
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,700
I need that ticket stub
back so I can get

437
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:10,000
my mother's fur coat out.

438
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,366
Oh, the stub.

439
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,053
Yeah. I left it
in my-- My pants.

440
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:13,533
Yeah. I left it
in my-- My pants.

441
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:15,033
Where are your pants?

442
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:17,866
Well-- I sold them
to Bania.

443
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,866
What? You sold your pants
to Bania?

444
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,166
Let me in.

445
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,700
Why did you sell
your pants to Bania?

446
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:28,333
I had Uma Thurman's number
written on that stub.

447
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:29,833
I lost Uma's number.

448
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:32,166
Where are your clothes?

449
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,000
I told you.
I sold them to Bania.

450
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,500
You mean what you were wearing?

451
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:36,833
Yeah.

452
00:16:36,866 --> 00:16:38,466
How'd you expect
to get out of here?

453
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,766
Well, I didn't
think ahead.

454
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:50,833
This isn't gonna work
for me.

455
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:53,333
So if you could show me
something else.

456
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:55,000
No.

457
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:57,333
No?

458
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:59,666
No, because you're
taking that one.

459
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,200
I am?

460
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,066
Yes.
You wore it outside.

461
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,233
That's preposterous.

462
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:11,733
I suppose that salt stain came
from all the snow in the store.

463
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,166
Shall I wrap it,
or will you wear it out?

464
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,666
No, you can wrap it.

465
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,000
Kramer, you still in there?

466
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:26,200
JERRY:
Elaine?

467
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:28,333
Jerry?

468
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:29,533
Elaine?
Where's Kramer?

469
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:30,533
KRAMER:
Bania?

470
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:31,533
Kramer?

471
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:33,233
JERRY:
I'm going out.

472
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:34,666
Jerry.
Bania.

473
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,500
Kramer, I want my money back
for this suit.

474
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,666
Your nancy-boy cream leaked
all over the pocket.

475
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,866
Suits ruined.

476
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,866
Well, you're not getting
any money back.

477
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,866
Jerry, come back.

478
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,053
Excuse me.

479
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:44,066
Excuse me.

480
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,300
Uma's number's
on that ticket.

481
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,033
Never mind Uma. I need to get
my mother's fur coat back.

482
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:52,166
Why don't you just give him
the money for the suit.

483
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,333
I'm not gonna give him
$300 now for a suit

484
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:57,233
with moisturizer cream
all over it.

485
00:17:57,266 --> 00:17:58,833
I got an idea.

486
00:17:58,866 --> 00:17:59,866
What?

487
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,766
I can't believe
I'm gonna do this.

488
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:05,300
JERRY: Can I talk to you
for a second?

489
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,566
How's everything going?

490
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,900
Pretty good.
Yeah.

491
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:10,366
Well, see,
the thing of it is,

492
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,066
I'm in a bit
of an awkward position here

493
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,053
because I don't wanna get
between you two guys,

494
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:14,400
because I don't wanna get
between you two guys,

495
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:17,133
but...I need
a dry-cleaning ticket

496
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,733
that's in the pocket
of those pants.

497
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:21,233
Well, all you gotta do is tell
Kramer to give me my money back

498
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,000
and you'll get your ticket.

499
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:24,966
Yeah, yeah.
All right.

500
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,900
Well, uh, tell you what
I will do, Bania.

501
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,566
You give me the ticket,

502
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,166
and, uh, I will take you out
for a nice dinner.

503
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,300
Can we go back to Mendy's?

504
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,466
You wanna go to Mendy's,
I'll take you to Mendy's.

505
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,333
Twice.
I wanna go twice.

506
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:43,033
All right, let's
be reasonable, Bania.

507
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:44,566
I'm taking you out
for a nice dinner.

508
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,233
All I want is a ticket
from that pocket.

509
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:47,700
I think that's
a pretty good deal.

510
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:49,133
Two Mendy's.

511
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,966
All right.

512
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,133
Just give me the ticket.

513
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,633
There you go.
Ohh!

514
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,033
But, Mr. Steinbrenner,

515
00:18:57,066 --> 00:19:00,233
how can I be expected to perform
my job properly,

516
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:04,033
knowing that my subordinate
is making more money than I am?

517
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:06,900
With all due respect, sir,
it's out of whack.

518
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:08,700
Uh-huh. I understand
what you're saying.

519
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:10,833
I know what it's like
to be financially strapped.

520
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:11,866
When I was a young man,

521
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,053
I used to hitchhike
to work.

522
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:13,066
I used to hitchhike
to work.

523
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,033
One time I got picked up
by a bakery truck.

524
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:16,500
You think that stuff
smells good?

525
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:18,666
Try being cooped up in the back
of one of those babies.

526
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,900
I couldn't look at a doughnut
for the next two years.

527
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:22,966
Well, not that I was ever
one for the sweets.

528
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,500
Sure, I like a cupcake now
and then like everybody else.

529
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,500
You know, I like it when
they have a little cream

530
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,366
on the inside.
It's a surprise. That's good.

531
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,166
Plus the chocolate ones
are good too.

532
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,066
Sometimes, I just can't
even make up my mind.

533
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,833
A lot of times,
I'll mix the two together,

534
00:19:35,866 --> 00:19:37,200
make a vanilla fudge.

535
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:39,033
Let me in.
It's me.

536
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:40,166
Here.

537
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,833
You don't know what
this is costing me.

538
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:43,053
All right.
Nice work.

539
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:43,466
All right.
Nice work.

540
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,733
Where's Uma's number?

541
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:49,566
The moisturizer smudged out
the phone number.

542
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,533
The dry-cleaning number's
gone too.

543
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,900
It must have been
the botanical extracts.

544
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:56,400
Give me that.

545
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,200
Hey, Bania.

546
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,633
The dinner's off.

547
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,466
The ticket's no good.
The numbers are all smudged out.

548
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,833
You trying to get
out of Mendy's?

549
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:07,833
You can't do that.

550
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:09,400
The ticket is worthless.

551
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:10,533
You promised me.

552
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:18,833
Hey. Isn't that
my mother's fur coat?

553
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,133
No, it's not.

554
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,166
It is.
Give me that back.

555
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,400
[CLAMORING]

556
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:39,300
Do you think the dry-cleaner's
your own personal closet?

557
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,800
Hey, Donna. Think you can get
the salt stain out of this?

558
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:42,900
Let me see.

559
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:43,053
Piece of cake.

560
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:43,900
Piece of cake.

561
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:45,066
Bring it in.

562
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,900
What size is it?

563
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,533
Mmm. This soup
is great.

564
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:03,666
Yeah, it's very good.

565
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,633
I told you Mendy's had
the best pea soup.

566
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,533
The best, Jerry, the best.

567
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,133
Are you enjoying it?

568
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,700
Yeah. I'm having
a wonderful time.

569
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:13,053
Wait until you try
the swordfish.

570
00:21:13,053 --> 00:21:13,466
Wait until you try
the swordfish.

571
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,700
You know, Jerry,
I was thinking.

572
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,400
For our next meal, do you think
we should come here,

573
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:20,333
or should we go someplace else?

574
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,833
You know,
it has its pros and cons.

575
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:24,366
On the one hand, here,
you're guaranteed a great meal.

576
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,333
On the other hand--

577
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:26,633
Yeah, yeah.
I know.

578
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,533
This would be good,
but it would be the same.

579
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:30,733
But if we go someplace else,
it would be different,

580
00:21:30,766 --> 00:21:32,366
but it might not be as good.

581
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,366
It's a gamble.

582
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,866
I get it.

583
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,033
Yeah. Well, let's hurry up
and eat.

584
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:40,500
I gotta get out of here.
I'm meeting a woman for a drink.

585
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,866
Oh, and who might that be?

586
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,053
Some woman named Uma.

587
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:43,866
Some woman named Uma.

588
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,633
I got her number off that ticket
before it was smudged.

589
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,200
Hope she's good-looking.

590
00:22:00,722 --> 00:22:02,255
If you are a waiter
or a waitress

591
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:03,788
and you ever see me
in a restaurant,

592
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,122
I'm telling you right now,

593
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:06,855
I don't wanna hear
about the specials.

594
00:22:06,888 --> 00:22:08,522
I don't wanna know
about the specials.

595
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:10,722
I'm sick of the specials.
I hate the specials.

596
00:22:10,755 --> 00:22:12,688
My feeling is, if the specials
were so special,

597
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:13,855
they'd be on the menu.

598
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:16,122
You know what's
special about them?

599
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:18,522
They don't know
if anybody likes it.

600
00:22:18,555 --> 00:22:21,555
They always have those overly
creative descriptions

601
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:23,288
of the specials, too, you know.

602
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:25,455
The veal is
lightly slapped...

603
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:28,288
and then sequestered
in a one-bedroom suite,

604
00:22:28,322 --> 00:22:29,235
with a white wine intravenous.

605
00:22:29,235 --> 00:22:30,488
with a white wine intravenous.
