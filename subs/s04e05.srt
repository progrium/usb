00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,033
My parents had
two constant arguments

2
00:00:03,066 --> 00:00:05,000
while they were driving,

3
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:07,833
over either how fast
my father was going,

4
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:10,233
or how much gas was left
in the tank.

5
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:12,533
My father had
a standard defense

6
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:14,533
for either one of these.
It was always,

7
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:16,233
"That's because
you're looking at it

8
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,833

If you were over here--

it looks from where
you're sitting,

12
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:24,733
it looks like
I'm doing 90 on empty,

JERRY:
So George and I went up to NBC,

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,166
and we told them
the idea for the series,

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,966
and now we're just waiting
to sign the contract.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,166
And they liked the idea?
Yeah.

What do you got,

23
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,633
Since when
is George a writer?

24
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,666
What writer?
It's a sitcom.

25
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,866
This is so exciting.

26
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,466
When are you
going to sign the contract?

27
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,666
Soon. There's
a couple of problems.

28
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,666
Jerry, I wanna tell you,
that meal was the worst.

29
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,700
What do you expect?

30
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:58,700
It's airline food.

31

They give you
that fish.

32
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,000
How could you
eat fish on a plane?

33

such a big stink

34

every time I have
a piece of meat.

What kind of problems?

36
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:06,566
What kind of problems?

37
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,333
Well, George doesn't think
$13,000 is enough money.

38
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:10,866
What? He's not even working.

39
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,000
George is right.

to get away with murder.

Believe me,
they're all crooks.

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,000
Jerry, I want you
to sign that contract.

43

We're gonna sign it!

George is out

gonna have to pass.

541
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:05,133
was heard
your diagnosis.

542
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,700
I'm not interested
in his diagnosis.

543
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:08,033
He's a bum.

544
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:10,166
You came all the way
from Florida to see him.

545
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,366
I wanna know what kind
of an office is this

546
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,700
where you can't leave
your pants in the room.

547
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,266
You tell me.

548
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:20,200
I'm sorry,

549
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:22,633
but there's somebody else.

550
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,066
Mm-hmm.

551
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,533
Well, it's nothing
I planned on happening,

552
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:30,533
you know?

553
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:32,033
It just kind of happened.

554
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:34,000
Tell me about him.

555
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:35,333
Well...

556
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:37,033
There's not really much to tell,
you know?

557
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:39,166
He's just a guy, really.

558
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,466
Yes, well,
I assume he's a guy...

559
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,900
Right.

560
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:44,333
And you've known him
how long?

561
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:47,666
Years...

562
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,200
Many years.

563
00:17:49,233 --> 00:17:50,566
We've been close friends,

564
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,400
and then recently,
something just, you know--

565
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:55,966
Ahh-- happened.

566
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,244
You mean sexually?

567
00:17:56,244 --> 00:17:57,666
You mean sexually?

568
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,666
Yeah. Yeah.

569
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,600
Sexually.

[TELEPHONE BUZZES]

571
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:11,466
I think your, um...

572
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,333
Excuse me.

573
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:14,333
Yes?

574
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:18,066
Oh, yes, Bobo.

575
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,400
No, it's just east of Madison.

576
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,133
Around four would be fine.

577
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,166
All right, Bobo.

578
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,100
See you then.

579
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:27,900
I'm sorry.

580
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,233
Where were we?

581
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:33,833
Well, I was just telling you
about this other guy.

582
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:34,833
Elaine.

583
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:35,833
Yeah?

584
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,300
Do you remember your dream

585
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,200
where you had a sexual encounter
with a Chinese woman?

586
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:44,666
Yeah.

587
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:47,312
[COUGHS]

588
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:48,312
Mm-hmm.

589
00:18:48,345 --> 00:18:50,412
Elaine, I'm concerned about you.

590
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:51,779
Oh, no, no, no, no.

591
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:54,412
Don't concern yourself with me,
because I'm good.

592
00:18:54,445 --> 00:18:55,412
I'm very good.

593
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:56,244
I mean,
I'm really very, very good.

594
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:58,412
I mean,
I'm really very, very good.

595
00:18:58,445 --> 00:19:00,812
Elaine...

596
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:02,779
Have you been urinating
a lot again?

597
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:09,745
No.

598
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:13,412
And how often
have you been seeing, um...

599
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:14,412
I'm sorry.

600
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,745
What is his name?

601
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,745
His name?

602
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:17,912
Yes. His name.

603
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:19,979
Well, what's the difference?

604
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:21,812
Are you afraid
to tell me his name?

605
00:19:21,845 --> 00:19:24,979
No, no, I just don't really see
how that's relevant.

606
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:26,244
It doesn't matter
if you don't see how.

607
00:19:26,244 --> 00:19:26,579
It doesn't matter
if you don't see how.

608
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:27,579
I see how.

609
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:31,079
Uh, his name.

610
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:32,412
I don't even know.

611
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:33,812
All right,
you wanna know his name?

612
00:19:33,845 --> 00:19:34,812
I'll tell you his name.

613
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:38,012
His name is...Kramer.

614
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,579
Kramer.

615
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:43,645
Is that his first name
or his last name?

616
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,045
You know,

617
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,545
I'm really uncomfortable
talking about this.

618
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:49,312
Elaine, I want you
to do me a favor.

619
00:19:49,345 --> 00:19:50,312
What?

620
00:19:50,345 --> 00:19:52,145
I want you to tell
this young man

621
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:53,379
to give me a call.

622
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:54,945
It's very important
that I speak to him.

623
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:56,244
Oh, no, no, no,
I can't do that.

624
00:19:56,244 --> 00:19:56,745
Oh, no, no, no,
I can't do that.

625
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,545
You can do it,
and you will do it.

626
00:19:58,579 --> 00:19:59,545
No, I can't.

627
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:01,845
You can, and you will.

628
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,379
Okay, okay,

629
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,412
I'll have Kramer
give you a call.

630
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:11,745
So you didn't even let
the doctor treat you?

631
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:13,645
I wouldn't give him
the satisfaction.

632
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,045
Why did you leave
your wallet in your pants?

633
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,245
What are you
talking about?

634
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,245
What, was I supposed to
hide it somewhere?

635
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,479
You could've
taken it with you.

636
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:22,645
Oh, yeah. I'll be lying
on an X-ray table

637
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,979
with my wallet
in my mouth.

638
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,244
Hello.

639
00:20:26,244 --> 00:20:26,812
Hello.

640
00:20:26,845 --> 00:20:27,812
Hello.

641
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:28,945
Hi, Uncle Leo.

642
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:32,779
I just spoke
to Dr. Dembrow's son.

643
00:20:32,812 --> 00:20:34,945
He said they almost had to call
the police.

644
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:36,279
What are you
talking about?

645
00:20:36,312 --> 00:20:37,879
I'm the one who should've
called the police.

646
00:20:37,912 --> 00:20:39,112
They stole my wallet.

647
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:40,879
You know
how hard it was for me

648
00:20:40,912 --> 00:20:42,212
to get
that appointment for you?

649
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:44,479
You can't just walk in
on this guy.

650
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:46,045
He did me
a personal favor...

651
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,279
All right, Leo.

652
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,279
And you walked out
without paying.

653
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:50,479
How was I
supposed to pay?

654
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:52,112
I didn't have
my wallet.

655
00:20:52,145 --> 00:20:54,745
Well, I hope
you send him a check.

656
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:56,145
What for?

657
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:56,244
What for?

658
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:57,212
What for?

659
00:20:57,245 --> 00:20:59,579
This man was nice enough
to see you.

660
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:01,745
He did me
a personal favor.

661
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:04,445
That's the second time
you said personal favor.

662
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:05,745
Why do you keep
saying that?

663
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:06,945
I said it once.

664
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:08,279
Twice...

665
00:21:08,312 --> 00:21:10,279
and Dembrow doesn't
even know you.

666
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,112
His son happens to live
on your floor.

667
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:18,079
Leo, where did you
get that watch?

668
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:21,145
You know
where I got this?

669
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:25,412
<i>I found it in the garbage can.</i>

670
00:21:25,445 --> 00:21:26,244
<i>It kept terrible time.</i>

671
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,279
<i>It kept terrible time.</i>

672
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:28,712
I brought it over
to Jimmy Sherman

673
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,412
right here
on 85th and Columbus.

674
00:21:31,445 --> 00:21:33,279
Gave it to me back
the next day.

675
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,879
Works great.

676
00:21:34,912 --> 00:21:36,279
What kind of an idiot

677
00:21:36,312 --> 00:21:39,379
throws away
a perfectly good watch?

678
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:41,912
Doesn't that watch look
like the one that we gave Jerry?

679
00:21:41,945 --> 00:21:42,912
Hey,
where's the waiter?

680
00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:44,045
Dad, what do you say,

681
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,245
we have some
red meat tonight?

682
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,445
Let's live a little.

683
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:48,912
Let's see that.

684
00:21:48,945 --> 00:21:51,512
Could we continue this
another time?

685
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,412
Don't you hate
"to be continueds" on TV?

686
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:02,579
It's horrible when you sense
the "to be continued" coming,

687
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,579
you know?

688
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:04,579
You're watching the show.

689
00:22:04,612 --> 00:22:05,779
You're into the story.

690
00:22:05,812 --> 00:22:07,079
Then there's, like,
five minutes left,

691
00:22:07,112 --> 00:22:08,079
and suddenly you realize,

692
00:22:08,112 --> 00:22:10,945
"Hey, they can't make it.

693
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:13,379
"Timmy's still stuck
in the cave.

694
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:16,245
There's no way they wrap this up
in five minutes."

695
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,579
I mean, the whole reason
you watch a TV show

696
00:22:18,612 --> 00:22:20,445
is because it ends.

697
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:22,812
If I wanted a long, boring story
with no point to it,

698
00:22:22,845 --> 00:22:25,645
I have my life.

699
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,244
A comedian can't do that.

700
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:26,645
A comedian can't do that.

701
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:27,979
See, I can't go,
