It's a lovely tribute to our
past president, by the way.

6
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:14,333

got shot in the head.

and sit on it too.

It's just incomprehensible that
you would buy a thing like this.

some kind of a family lunch.

You gonna
meet the mother?

"how do you do?"

You know, I'm better
with the mothers

You should
date the mothers.

with the daughters,
