176
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:50,777
Dr. Strugatz
must have made a mistake.

177
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:52,646
Not a chance.

178
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,782
I'm afraid I'll just
have to find someone else

179
00:05:54,816 --> 00:05:56,751
to accompany me on my journey.

180
00:05:56,784 --> 00:05:59,287
The Dark Continent is no place
for an addict, Elaine.

181
00:05:59,321 --> 00:06:00,956
Obviously, Mr. Peterman,

182
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:02,758
there's something wrong
with this test.

183
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:03,200
I don't take opium.

184
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,994
I don't take opium.

185
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:08,132
Let me take another one, please?
I'll call the doctor right now.

186
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:10,300
I'll take a pop urine test.

187
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:12,837
All right, Elaine.

188
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,772
Oh, thank you, Mr. Peterman.

189
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:15,807

190
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,844

Bitter cold. Bitter!

196
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:29,857
I was out
for five minutes before.

197
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,625
I couldn't feel
my extremities.

198
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,200
What extremities?

201
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:40,536
Seventy-nine.

202
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,837
That's almost 80.

203
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:44,274
Yeah, I read someplace,

204
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:47,644
the life expectancy
in Florida is 81.

205
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:50,782

I don't bet.

00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,341
Well, what about the dolphins?

218
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:14,876
You can swim
with the dolphins.

219
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,078
I don't swim.

00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:19,181
Well, you could pet them.

221
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:21,718
They come right out of the water
onto the sidewalks.

"Rid"? Ma, come on.

"Care."

had gone.

But a different sort of trader
still lurked about.

00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,170
"Just a taste," he said.
