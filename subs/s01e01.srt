To be out. This is out.

enjoyable experiences of life.

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,533
Do you know how people talk
about "We should go out"?

00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:13,700
This is what
they're talking about.

This whole thing.

<i>We're all out now.</i>
<i>No one is home.</i>

00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,366
Not one person here is home.
We're all out. There are people

"He didn't tell me
where he was going.

00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,066
You take the shower,
get all ready,

Then you stand around.
What do you do? You go,

"We gotta be getting back."

You wanna go to sleep,
you wanna get up,

you wanna go out again
tomorrow, right?

Wherever you are in life,

it's my feeling,
you've gotta go.

JERRY:
See that? To me, that button's in the worst possible spot.

31
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:06,800
The second button literally
makes or breaks the shirt.

32
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,866
Look at it.
It's too high.

33
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,800
It's in no man's land.

34
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,633
You look like you live
with your mother.

35
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,300
Are you through?

36
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,333
You do, of course,
try on when you buy.

37
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,366
Yes, it was purple.
I liked it.

38
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,533
I don't actually recall
considering the buttons.

Oh, you don't <i>recall.</i>

Er, n-no,
not at this time.

41
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:25,733
Well, senator,
I'd just like to know

42
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:27,400
what you knew
and when you knew it.

43
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:28,600
Mr. Seinfeld,

44
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:28,733
Mr. Seinfeld,

00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:30,066
Mr. Costanza.

46
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,466
Are you sure
this is decaf?

47
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,133
Where's
the orange indicator?

48
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,200
It's missing.

49
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:36,133
I have to do it in my head.

50
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,366

It's very challenging work.

55
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,500
Can you relax?
It's a cup of coffee.

56
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,166
Claire's
a professional waitress.

57
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,233
Trust me, George.

58
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:52,533
No one has any interest
in seeing you on caffeine.

59
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:57,533
How come you're not doing
the second show tomorrow?

60
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:58,600
Well, there's this, uh, woman
who might be coming in.

61
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,233
Well, there's this, uh, woman
who might be coming in.

62
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,633
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

63
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:04,500
What coming in?
What woman is coming in?

64
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:07,200
I told you about Laura,
the girl I met in Michigan.

65
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:08,200
No, you didn't.

66
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:09,533
I thought I told you
about her.

67
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:11,366
Yeah. She teaches
political science,

68
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,500
I met her the night
I did the show in Lansing.

69
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,433
Huh.

70
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:16,533
There's no milk in here.
Wait, wait, wait.

71
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:18,700
Why's there no milk?
What is she--? What is she like?

72
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:20,200
Oh, she's really great.

73
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:21,866
She's got, like,
a real warmth about her.

74

And she's really bright
and really pretty and...

75
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:27,633
And the conversation,
though, I mean, it was...

76
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,600
You know, talking with her,
it was like talking with you,

77
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,733
You know, talking with her,
it was like talking with you,

78
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:32,733
but, you know,
obviously much better.

79
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:35,166
So, you know,
wh-what happened?

80
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Well, nothing happened,
you know.

81
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:37,400
But it was great.

82
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:38,566

but it was...

83

This is great!

00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,166
Yeah. Yeah.
So, you know she called

85
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,333
and said she wants to go out
with you tomorrow night?

Yeah. Well, not exactly.

I mean, she said--

90
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,733
You know, she called
this morning and said

91
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:52,400
she had to come in
for a seminar,

92
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:53,733

find a decent hotel room.

349
00:12:44,407 --> 00:12:45,707
A decent hotel room.

350
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:46,874
Yeah, a decent hotel room.

351
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:48,674
Would it be
terribly inconvenient

352
00:12:48,707 --> 00:12:49,941
if she stayed at my place?

353
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:52,674
You can't be serious.

354
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:54,241
This is New York City.

355
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,541
There must be 11 million
decent hotel rooms.

356
00:12:57,574 --> 00:12:58,607
What do you need, a--?

357
00:12:58,641 --> 00:12:59,674
A flag?

358
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:01,507
This is
the signal, Jerry.

359
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,389
This is the signal.

360
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:04,241
This is the signal.

361
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:05,841
This is the signal.
Thank you, Mr. Signal.

362
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:06,941
Where were you
yesterday?

363
00:13:06,974 --> 00:13:09,241
I think I was affected
by the caffeine.

364
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:10,541
Ho, ho.

365
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:14,241
All right. Good dog.
Good dog. All right.

366
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:15,774
Hey, he really likes you,
George.

367
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:17,741
Well, that's flattering.

368
00:13:19,707 --> 00:13:21,707
Ah, he's getting
a drink of water.

369
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:27,507
Is this
for that girl?

370
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,707
Yeah.

371
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,407
Why even give her
an option?

372
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:32,374
This is a person I like.

373
00:13:32,407 --> 00:13:33,389
It's not how to score
on spring break.

374
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:34,841
It's not how to score
on spring break.

375
00:13:34,874 --> 00:13:36,674
All right. Can we go?
I'm double-parked.

376
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:37,741
I'm gonna get
a ticket.

377
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:39,541
Yeah, okay.
Oh, wait a second.

378
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:40,907
I-- I forgot to clean
the bathroom.

379
00:13:40,941 --> 00:13:42,374
So what?
That's good.

380
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:43,541
Now how could that
be good?

381
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,441
Because filth
is good.

382
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:48,041
What do you think, rock stars
have sponges and ammonia

383
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:49,274
lying around
the bathroom?

384
00:13:49,307 --> 00:13:52,374
You think they have a woman
coming over, "I gotta tidy up"?

385
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:54,741
In these matters, you never do
what your instincts tell you.

386
00:13:54,774 --> 00:13:56,774
Always, always
do the opposite.

387
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:58,241
This is how you operate?

388
00:13:58,274 --> 00:13:59,041
Psh. Yeah, I wish.

389
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:01,174
Let me just wipe the sink.
It'll--

390
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,389
Why even give her an option for?
Just give me a second.

391
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:04,574
Why even give her an option for?
Just give me a second.

392
00:14:05,707 --> 00:14:07,741
It's unbelievable.
Yeah.

393
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:14,274
How's the real estate
business?

394
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:17,374
It's, uh, not bad.

395
00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:19,407
It's coming along.

396
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,974
Why, did you
need something?

397
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:24,907
You handle any of
that commercial

398
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:29,341
whhhhhh...real estate,
that...sshhhooo?

399
00:14:29,374 --> 00:14:31,374
Well, I might be
getting into that.

400
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:32,541
You keep me posted.

401
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:33,389
I'm aware of you.
All right, let's go.

402
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:35,374
I'm aware of you.
All right, let's go.

403
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:36,541
Let's go. Oh!

404
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:37,807
You're on-stage
in 25 minutes.

405
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:42,407
The dating world
is not a fun world.

406
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:45,274
It's a pressure world.

407
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:48,041
It's a world of tension,
it's a world of pain.

408
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:49,941
And if a woman comes over
to my house,

409
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:52,007
I gotta get that bathroom ready
because she needs things.

410
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,841
Women need equipment.
I don't know what they need.

411
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:55,507
I know I don't have it,
I know that.

412
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,941
You-- You know
what they need?

413
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:58,574
Women seem to need
a lot of cotton balls.

414
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:02,341
This is one-- Always been one of
the most amazing things to me.

415
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:03,389
I have no cotton balls.
We're all human beings.

416
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:04,907
I have no cotton balls.
We're all human beings.

417
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:06,074
What is the story?

418
00:15:06,107 --> 00:15:07,407
I've never had one,

419
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:08,407
I never bought one,

420
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,107
I never needed one.

421
00:15:10,141 --> 00:15:12,507
I've never been in a situation
where I thought to myself,

422
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,274
"I could use a cotton ball
right now."

423
00:15:14,307 --> 00:15:15,507
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

424
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,441
"I could certainly
get out of this mess."

425
00:15:18,474 --> 00:15:21,541
Women need them.
And they don't need one or two.

426
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:23,841
They need thousands of them.
They need bags.

427
00:15:23,874 --> 00:15:25,107
They're like
peat moss bags.

428
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:27,107
Have you ever seen
these giant bags?

429
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:28,841
They're huge...

430
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:30,274
and two days later, they're out.

431
00:15:30,307 --> 00:15:32,041
They're gone.
The bag is empty.

432
00:15:32,074 --> 00:15:33,374
Where are the cotton balls,
ladies?

433
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:35,107
What are you
doing with them?

434
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:36,441
The only time
I ever see them

435
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:38,107
is in the bottom of
your little wastebasket.

436
00:15:38,141 --> 00:15:39,441
There's two or three
that look like

437
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:40,941
they've been through
some horrible experience.

438
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:43,341
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

439
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:44,507
Tortured, interrogated,

440
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,507
I don't know
what happened to them.

441
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,741
I once went out
with a girl,

442
00:15:47,774 --> 00:15:50,441
she left a little Ziploc Baggie
of cotton balls at my house.

443
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:51,607
I didn't know what to do.

444
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:54,841
I put them on the kitchen floor
like little tumbleweeds.

445
00:15:54,874 --> 00:15:56,441
I thought maybe
the cockroaches would see it,

446
00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:58,407
figure, "This is a dead town.
Let's move on."

447
00:15:58,441 --> 00:15:59,607
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

448
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:02,374
The dating world is a world
of pressure. Let's face it,

449
00:16:02,407 --> 00:16:03,389
a date is a job interview
that lasts all night.

450
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:06,074
a date is a job interview
that lasts all night.

451
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:08,207
The only difference between
a date and job interview is

452
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:09,941
not many job interviews
is there a chance

453
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:12,907
you'll end up naked
at the end of it.

454
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:14,107
You know, "Well, Bill,

455
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:16,007
"the boss thinks
you're the man for the position

456
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,341
"Why don't you strip down
and meet

457
00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:19,007
some of the people
you'll be working with?"

458
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,307
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

459
00:16:23,141 --> 00:16:25,107
Wouldn't it be great
if you could ask a woman

460
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:25,907
what she's thinking?

461
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,941
Psh. What a world
that would be

462
00:16:27,974 --> 00:16:30,374
if you could just ask a woman
what she's thinking.

463
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,374
You know, instead...

464
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,389
I'm like a detective.
I gotta pick up clues.

465
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:33,574
I'm like a detective.
I gotta pick up clues.

466
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:36,241
The whole thing's
a murder investigation.

467
00:16:36,274 --> 00:16:37,907
All right, listen, listen.
Don't get worked up.

468
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:39,241
because you're gonna know
the whole story

469
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:40,541
the minute she steps off
the plane..

470
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:41,841
Really, how?

471
00:16:41,874 --> 00:16:42,941
Because it's all
in the greeting.

472
00:16:42,974 --> 00:16:44,507
All right. If she puts
the bags down

473
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,241
before she greets you,
that's a good sign.

474
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:47,374
Right.
You know, anything in--

475
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,374
In the lip area is good.
Lip area.

476
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,941
You know, a hug,
definitely good.

477
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:52,107
Hug is definitely good.
Sure.

478
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:53,607
Although, what if it's
one of those hugs

479
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:54,941
where the shoulders
are touching,

480
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:56,107
the hips are
8 feet apart?

481
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,174
Those are brutal.
I hate that.

482
00:16:57,207 --> 00:17:00,007
You know how they do that?
Also, a shake is bad.

483
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,907
Shake is bad. But what if
it's the two-hander?

484
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:03,389
The hand on the bottom,
the hand on the top.

485
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:03,941
The hand on the bottom,
the hand on the top.

486
00:17:03,974 --> 00:17:05,107
The warm look
in the eyes.

487
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:06,374
Hand sandwich. Right.
Right.

488
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:07,941
Well, that's open
to interpretation

489
00:17:07,974 --> 00:17:09,341
because so much depends
on the layering

490
00:17:09,374 --> 00:17:11,374
and the quality of
the wetness in the eyes--

491
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:14,341
Guess who.
Hey, hey. He--

492
00:17:14,374 --> 00:17:16,441
BOTH:
Hey!

493
00:17:16,474 --> 00:17:17,441
Hey!

494
00:17:17,474 --> 00:17:18,974
Hey.

495
00:17:19,974 --> 00:17:21,607
Hey. It's good to see you.

496
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,374
Hi.

497
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:24,274
This is my friend George.

Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.
How are you?

This is Laura.
Sure, Laura, sure.

I can't believe you're here.

The bags. Let's get the bags.
Oh, yeah, sure, the bags.

00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:38,041
Here, Laura. I'm sorry.
Oh, thank you.

506
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:39,274
Boy, that was
an interesting greeting.

507
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:40,207
Did you notice that,
George?

508
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:42,607
Yes, the "surprise blindfold"
greeting.

509
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:44,541
That wasn't in the manual.

510
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:48,407
So...

511
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:49,441
what do you think?

512
00:17:49,474 --> 00:17:51,007
Whoa.

513
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,374
Wow.

514
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:53,941
This place isn't so bad.

515
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:57,207
Yeah, it kind of motivates me
to work on the road.

516
00:17:58,307 --> 00:18:00,407
So make yourself
at home.

00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,907
So, uh...

00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,074
Actually, um,
do you have any wine?

I think I do.

if I turn this down?

Jerry, I was wondering

528
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:50,374
would it be possible,
and if it's not, fine,

529
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:53,041
for me to stay here
tomorrow night too?

530
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:57,541
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.
Yeah, why don't you stay?

531
00:18:57,574 --> 00:18:59,407
Yeah. Um...

532
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,074
What is your schedule
for tomorrow?

533
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:03,389
Are you doing
anything?

Oh. No, I'd love
to do something.

I have my seminar
in the morning,

537
00:19:07,574 --> 00:19:09,007
but after that
I'm wide open.

538
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,607
Really? What would you
like to do?

but I'd love to go
on one of those

around Manhattan.

543
