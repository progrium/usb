Whenever you ask for
the doggy bag in a restaurant,

00:00:03,207 --> 00:00:04,976
there's a certain sense
of failure there, isn't it?

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,078

to the waiter,

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,159
because a doggy bag means either
you were out at a restaurant

If you're a guy, and you ask

the O usually
stays with the B.

And I gotta be
honest with you.

537
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,070
I gotta tell you...

538
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:17,374
ever since I saw you
holding hands with that woman,

539
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,376
I can't get you
out of my mind.

540
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:20,511
Really?

541
00:19:20,545 --> 00:19:23,014
Yeah. You're just so...

542
00:19:23,048 --> 00:19:24,049
hip.

543
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:26,452
Oh, my God.

544
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:28,019
What?
It's Allison.

545
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:30,757
I dated her right after you.
She was obsessed with me.

546
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:36,096
George?

547
00:19:37,498 --> 00:19:37,752
[LAUGHS]
Allison, hi!

548
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:39,633
[LAUGHS]
Allison, hi!

549
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:42,471
Oh, my God! How are you?

550
00:19:42,504 --> 00:19:45,207
Good. You know,
you owe me $50.

551
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,910
Fifty, right, right.

552
00:19:47,943 --> 00:19:49,912
I don't have it on me right now.

553
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:51,581
Allison, this is Susan.
Susan, Allison.

554
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:52,583
Nice to meet you.

555
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:53,584
Nice to meet you.

556
00:19:53,617 --> 00:19:58,389
That's a beautiful vest.

557
00:19:58,422 --> 00:20:00,192
Thank you.

558
00:20:05,964 --> 00:20:07,466
I don't understand it.

559
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:07,752
I was with her last night
at my apartment.

560
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:09,268
I was with her last night
at my apartment.

561
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:10,737
It was very romantic.

562
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,639
You know, with that
fake wood wallpaper,

563
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:14,575
the atmosphere
is fabulous in there now.

564
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:16,244
It's like a ski lodge.

565
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:18,246
What year did you say this was?
'90.

566
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:20,081
Anyway, we were on the couch,

567
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:21,082
I move to hug her,

568
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:22,484
next thing, she tells me
she's leaving.

569
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:23,786
She's gotta get up early.

570
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,087
That's strange.

571
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:26,656
How many miles
you got on this thing?

572
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:28,358
Twenty-three thousand.

573
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:29,592
And I was
looking good too.

574
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:30,961
I had a nice
new shirt on,

575
00:20:30,994 --> 00:20:32,263
I'm wearing your jacket.

576
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:34,265
[WHISPERS]
Wait a second.

577
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:35,499
My jacket!

578
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:36,935
I wore that in the car!

579
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:37,752
The beast!

580
00:20:37,752 --> 00:20:38,136
The beast!

581
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,804
Uggggghhh!

582
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,141
This wicked funk.

583
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,509
I can't sell this car.

584
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:48,482
This...

585
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:50,117
thing!

586
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:52,153
It's got to be stopped.

587
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:53,220
What do you
wanna do?

588
00:20:53,254 --> 00:20:54,722
Sauce me.

589
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,413
Why do we need BO?

590
00:21:42,446 --> 00:21:44,348
What is the function of it?

591
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:46,450
Everything in nature
has a reason, has a purpose,

592
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:47,685
except BO.

593
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:48,920
Doesn't make any sense.

594
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:51,924
Do something good,
hard work, exercise,

595
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:53,926
smell very bad.

596
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:56,029
This is the way
the human being is designed.

597
00:21:56,062 --> 00:21:58,197
You move, you stink.

598
00:21:58,231 --> 00:22:01,035
Why can't our bodies help us?

599
00:22:01,068 --> 00:22:03,638
Why can't sweat smell good?

600
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:05,473
It'd be a different world,
wouldn't it?

601
00:22:05,506 --> 00:22:07,108
Instead of putting your laundry
in the hamper,

602
00:22:07,142 --> 00:22:08,777
you put it in a vase.

603
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,078
Go down to the drug store,

604
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:12,248
pick up some odorant
and perspirant.

605
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:13,783
Probably have a dirty sweat sock

606
00:22:13,816 --> 00:22:15,618
hanging from
the rearview mirror of your car.

607
00:22:15,652 --> 00:22:16,971
And then,
on a really special night,

608
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,137
maybe a little underwear

609
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,971
coming out
of your breast pocket.

610
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:22,037
Just to show her
that she's important.
