543
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,570
I even got an idea
out of it.

544
00:19:58,603 --> 00:20:00,203
The detox poncho.

545
00:20:01,036 --> 00:20:01,936
See ya.

546
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:04,194
I'd like to speak
with the manager, please.

547
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:06,170
I'd like to speak
with the manager, please.

548
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:09,203
Mind your pace, boy!
Chop chop!

549
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:12,903
I've hit the wall!
I gotta take a break!

550
00:20:12,936 --> 00:20:16,170
Well, don't tarry.
I'm behind schedule as it is.

551
00:20:16,203 --> 00:20:17,336
Yah!

552
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,403
Boy?

553
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:19,570
Boy!

554
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:21,003
Kramer!

555
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:22,170
Whoa!

556
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:23,103
Wait!

557
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,903
[SCREAMING]

558
00:20:27,736 --> 00:20:28,903
Well,

559
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,870
this is the first day
of the rest of my life.

560
00:20:31,903 --> 00:20:33,870
[SCREAMING]

561
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:34,194
[SCREAMS]

562
00:20:34,194 --> 00:20:35,103
[SCREAMS]

563
00:20:47,436 --> 00:20:49,570
[♪]

564
00:20:51,703 --> 00:20:53,336
George,
what are you doing here?

565
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,570
I can't sell the book.

566
00:20:55,603 --> 00:20:57,003
It's been marked.

567
00:20:57,036 --> 00:20:58,236
It certainly has.

568
00:21:00,536 --> 00:21:02,403
So I'm going to steal
another one,

569
00:21:02,436 --> 00:21:04,070
and then I'm going
to return it.

570
00:21:04,103 --> 00:21:04,194
That way, everything is even.

571
00:21:04,194 --> 00:21:06,370
That way, everything is even.

572
00:21:06,403 --> 00:21:08,370
You defile one book,

573
00:21:08,403 --> 00:21:09,703
steal another,

574
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,336
ask for your money back,

575
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,203
and to you that's even.

576
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,370
I'm going in.

577
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,670
Did you want to speak
to the manager?

578
00:21:18,703 --> 00:21:22,070
Yes. My uncle Leo was caught
shoplifting here the other day.

579
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:25,336
Yes. Uncle Leo.
I remember him.

580
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,336
I'm sorry. Our policy is
we prosecute all shoplifters.

581
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,170
Oh, come on.
He's just a lonely old man.

582
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:31,836
All old people steal.

583
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,070
That's right.

584
00:21:33,103 --> 00:21:34,194
That's why we stopped
carrying batteries.

585
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:35,170
That's why we stopped
carrying batteries.

586
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:36,670
Look, I'll be honest with you,

587
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:38,670
We've had a lot of trouble
with theft lately,

588
00:21:38,703 --> 00:21:41,503
and my boss said I have
to make an example of someone.

589
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:42,503
So it could be anyone?

590
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:44,003
Mm, I guess.

591
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,936
As long as we catch him
in the act.

592
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:50,951
That guy!
Swarm!

593
00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:52,485
JERRY:
Swarm!

594
00:21:53,318 --> 00:21:55,451
No! Jerry!
