1
00:00:01,164 --> 00:00:02,968
I have a friend
that's about to get married.

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,037
They're having
the bachelor party

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,474
and the bridal shower
the same day.

4
00:00:05,508 --> 00:00:07,879
So it's conceivable that
while she's getting lingerie,

5
00:00:07,913 --> 00:00:09,082
he'll be at a nude bar

6
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:12,724
watching a table dancer
in the same outfit.

7
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:14,996
That is possible.

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,265
But, to me, the difference

9
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:17,501
between being single
and being married

10
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:18,905
is the form of government.

11
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:20,141
You see, when you're single,

12
00:00:20,174 --> 00:00:21,911
you are the dictator
of your own life.

13
00:00:21,946 --> 00:00:23,315
I have complete power.

14
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:24,451
When I give the order

15
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:26,489
to fall asleep on the sofa
with the TV on

16
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:29,463
in the middle of the day,
no one can overrule me.

17
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:30,000
When you're married,

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,632
When you're married,

19
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:34,207
you are part
of a vast decision-making body.

20
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,011
Before anything gets done,
there are meetings.

21
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:38,349
Committees have to study
the situation,

22
00:00:38,383 --> 00:00:40,989
and this is
if the marriage works.

23
00:00:41,022 --> 00:00:42,726
I think that's what's so painful
about divorce.

24
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:44,731
You've been impeached.
You weren't even the president.

25
00:00:52,516 --> 00:00:53,719
Hey, is it
my imagination,

26
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:55,088
or do really
good-looking women

27
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:56,090
walk a lot faster

28
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:57,694
than everybody else?

29
00:00:57,728 --> 00:00:59,766
We don't walk that fast.

30
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,001
No, seriously.

31
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:02,439
Seriously, we don't.

32
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:06,949
And the better looking they are,
the faster they go.

33
00:01:06,982 --> 00:01:08,954
I mean, I see them out there
on the street.

34
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:10,457
They're zooming around.
They're a blur.

35
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,227
It's like they got a motor
on their ass.

36
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:15,234
Hey, Jerry,
come on.

37
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:16,237
Let's go!

38
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:17,130
We're gonna miss
the previews.

39
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:17,239
We're gonna miss
the previews.

40
00:01:17,273 --> 00:01:18,809
What's the big hurry?

41
00:01:18,843 --> 00:01:20,647
Hey, how are we getting
to Scott Drake's party

42
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:21,984
on Saturday night?

43
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:24,656
Oh, Drake's party.
I forgot to buy a present.

44
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,227
What, I gotta buy
a present now?

45
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,396
Of course you do.

46
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:28,632
It's an
engagement party.

47
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:30,837
Oh, it never ends,
this present stuff.

48
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,009
Engagement present.
Then they get married.

49
00:01:33,042 --> 00:01:34,445
You gotta get them
something for that.

50
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,617
Then a baby,
there's another present.

51
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:38,354
Then the baby starts getting
their presents.

52
00:01:38,388 --> 00:01:39,758
I don't even like Drake.

53
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:40,760
You don't like
the Drake?

54
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:42,531
I hate the Drake.
I love the Drake.

55
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:44,268
How could you
not like the Drake?

56
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:45,371
Who's the Drake?

57
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:46,540
Who's the Drake?

58
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,130
The Drake is good.

59
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,543
The Drake is good.

60
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:49,112
No...

61
00:01:49,146 --> 00:01:51,117
So listen, what
are you gonna get him?

62
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:53,121
You know, I haven't
even met the fiancÃ©e.

63
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:55,026
Oh, whatever!

64
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,734
Elaine, look, I drew
this triangle freehand.

65
00:01:58,768 --> 00:01:59,904
It's a doodle.

66
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:02,343
It's perfect!

67
00:02:02,377 --> 00:02:04,347
So what?
That's easy.

68
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:05,584
Easy?

69
00:02:10,228 --> 00:02:11,498
Hi.

70
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,869
Hey, have you gotten
a present yet for the Drake?

71
00:02:13,903 --> 00:02:15,072
Uh, no, no, not yet.

72
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:16,209
Do you like the Drake?

73
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:17,130
I love the Drake.

74
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,614
I love the Drake.

75
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:20,351
I'm looking forward
to meeting the Drakette.

76
00:02:20,384 --> 00:02:23,057
I'm lukewarm
about the Drakette.

77
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,062
Boy, that's
a nice triangle.

78
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:28,403
It's isosceles.

79
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:29,740
Ooh...

80
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:30,742
Isosceles.

81
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,980
You know, I love
the name "isosceles."

82
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:33,983
If I had a kid,

83
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:36,221
I would name him
Isosceles.

84
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:38,660
Isosceles Kramer.

85
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,097
Hey, you know what.

86
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,934
Maybe we should all
chip in for the gift.

87
00:02:41,968 --> 00:02:43,003
The chip-in!

88
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:44,841
Hey, pretty good idea.
Yeah.

89
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,144
The chip-in!
Definitely.

90
00:02:46,178 --> 00:02:47,130
Let's go to that mall
in Lynbrook

91
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,514
Let's go to that mall
in Lynbrook

92
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:50,153
before we go to the party,
but we'll have to take your car.

It's got
the most room.

94
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:52,659
No, no, my car's
not running.

95
00:02:52,693 --> 00:02:54,597
What about
your father's car?

96
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,003
No, no, no, out of the question.
I was over there today.

97
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:59,208
He's got the good spot
in front of the good building

98
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:00,310
in the good neighborhood.

99
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:02,180
I know he's not gonna
want to move it.

Are you serious?

101
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,221
You don't know what
that spot means to him.

102
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:07,226
Once he gets it,
he doesn't go out for weeks.

103
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,796
How about this.

104
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,399
You put your car
in the good spot.

105
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:11,402
That'll hold
the good spot

106
00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:12,571
in front
of the good building,

107
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:14,008
and we can get
the good car.

108
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:15,010
Good thinking.

We're chipping in.

00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:21,725
I like this area.

115
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,728
I could live
out here.

00:03:22,762 --> 00:03:24,331
Yeah, we ought to
all get a house

117

a good idea.

the handicapped spot?

You think?

00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:41,571
No, no,
we'll find a space.

There's spaces
in the other lot.

Oh, I don't
wanna walk that far.

No! What if a handicapped
person needs it?

and park?

00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:55,237
Well, the space is there.
They must drive.

00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,606
No, they don't.

139
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,845
If they could drive,
they wouldn't be handicapped.

140
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:01,183

you're not handicapped?

that long anyway.

to park there.
