of pretending I'm excited

2
00:00:03,385 --> 00:00:05,220
every time
it's somebody's birthday.

3
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:06,221
You know what I mean?

4
00:00:06,254 --> 00:00:07,222
What is the big deal?

5
00:00:07,255 --> 00:00:08,656
How many times

6
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:11,226
do we have to celebrate
that someone was born?

7
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:12,560
Every year. Over and over.

8
00:00:12,593 --> 00:00:15,429
All you did
was not die for 12 months.

9
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:17,931
That's all you've done,
as far as I could tell.

10
00:00:17,964 --> 00:00:19,333
Those astrology things,

11

all the people

12
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:22,501
that have
the same birthday as you...

13
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:24,503
It's always an odd group
of people, too, isn't it?

14
00:00:24,537 --> 00:00:26,339
It's like, Ed Asner,
Elijah Mohammed,

15
00:00:26,372 --> 00:00:27,306

16
00:00:32,944 --> 00:00:35,346

17

I don't want to live!

18
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:39,983
Because of me?

19
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,118
You must be joking.

20
00:00:42,152 --> 00:00:44,220
Who wouldn't want to live
because of me?

21

I'm nothing.

22

No. You're something.

23

You can do better than me.

24
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,460
You could throw a dart
out the window

25
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:53,462
and hit someone
better than me.

26
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:54,463
I'm no good.

27
00:00:54,496 --> 00:00:55,897

You're killing me!

31

You're killing me!

32

This is Jerry Seinfeld.

41

to do an interview.

gonna get Jerry

43
00:01:21,752 --> 00:01:23,121
for his birthday?

I got him a great gift.

Really? What?

46
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,958
I got two tickets
to see <i>Guys and Dolls.</i>

What did you get him?

52

I got him a two-line phone.

Yeah, that's good.

54
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:41,604
Unbelievable.

55
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:42,604
She's not there.

56
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:43,805
What paper
does she write for?

57
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:46,073
She works for
the N.Y.U. school newspaper.

58
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,842
She's a grad student
in journalism.

00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,564
Let me
ask you something.

181
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:06,965
What do you think
of this shirt?

182
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:08,734
It's nice.

183
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:12,237
Jerry said he didn't like it.

184
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,671
I didn't say
I didn't like it.

185
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:14,739
I said it was okay.

186
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:16,140
Oh, you said
you didn't like it.

187
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:17,907
Oh, well, so what
if I don't like it?

188
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:19,909
Is that, like, the end
of the world or something?

189
00:06:19,943 --> 00:06:22,478
So how did you two meet?

190
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:25,181
Oh, actually, we met
in the gym locker room.

191
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:26,749
Yeah.

192
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:28,083
Actually, it was
in gym class.

193
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:29,154
I was trying
to climb the ropes,

194
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:30,052
I was trying
to climb the ropes,

195
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:31,987

was spotting me,

196
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,321
and, uh,

197
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:36,658
I kept slipping
and burning my thighs,

198
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:37,725
and then,
finally,

199
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,293
I slipped and I fell
on Jerry's head.

No. I got
my own place.

204
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:50,936
Oh, and do your parents know?

205
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,905

That's why my friend
said all that.

218

Well, I think I know
when my birthday is.

00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,300
They mention your name.

532
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,934
Don't you see
what it says here?

533
00:18:25,968 --> 00:18:28,471
Don't you understand
what that's implying?

534
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:30,105
No. What?

535
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:30,852
I'm gay!

536
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:32,307
I'm gay!

537
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,141
I'm a gay man!

538
00:18:34,176 --> 00:18:35,877
I'm very, very gay.

539
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,111
You're gay?

540
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:39,613
Extraordinarily gay.

541
00:18:39,646 --> 00:18:41,014
Steeped in gayness.

542
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:43,650
I don't believe it.

543
00:18:43,684 --> 00:18:44,818
All right.

544
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:46,552
You don't believe me?
Ask Jerry.

545
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:47,853
I will.

546
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:49,188
What do you mean, you will?

547
00:18:49,221 --> 00:18:50,823
No, no, no, no.
That's a bad idea.

548
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:52,057
Jerry's a very private person.

549
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:55,160
I want to hear it
from Jerry.

550
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,735
Oh,
can you ever forgive me?

551
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,171
I don't know.

552
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,146
All right,
I forgive you.

553
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:18,246
Mm.

554
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,481
You know,
the funny thing is,

555
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:21,182
I was attracted to you
immediately.

556
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:22,650
I was attracted to you too.

557
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:23,784
You remind me of Lois Lane.

558
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:39,064
Jerry, oh my God!
What are you doing?

559
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:42,267
What?

560
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,436
You're with a woman!

561
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:46,938
I know. What are you doing here?

562
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:49,941
I leave you alone
for two seconds,

563
00:19:49,974 --> 00:19:51,742
and this is
what you do?

564
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:52,743
I trusted you!

565
00:19:55,145 --> 00:19:56,780
Would you get the hell
out of here?

566
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:58,081
What's going on?

567
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,615
Yeah.
What's going on?

568
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:00,852
All right, tell her.
Go ahead.

569
00:20:00,852 --> 00:20:01,050
All right, tell her.
Go ahead.

570
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,284
Tell her what?

571
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:03,953
You know, about us.
Are you crazy?

572
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:04,954
Tell her, Jerry.
Tell her.

573
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:06,055
I'm not telling her
nothing!

574
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:07,622
Do you have any idea
what you're saying?

575
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:09,123
This is too weird.
Wait a minute!

576
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:10,291
Wait a minute,
wait a minute!

577
00:20:10,324 --> 00:20:11,960
You wrote the article.
Go ahead, tell her.

578
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:13,794
I'm out of here.

579
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:14,795
It's not true!

580
00:20:14,828 --> 00:20:17,430
It's not true!

581
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:20,000
Not that there's anything
wrong with that!

582
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:23,436
You stupid idiot!

583
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,436
Oh, please,
don't be upset.

584
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:26,638
Oh, would you
stop it with that stuff?

585
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:30,309
What's going on?

586
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:30,852
All right, I'll
tell you the truth.

587
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:31,777
All right, I'll
tell you the truth.

588
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,745
I'm not gay.

589
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:36,381
My name's Buck Naked.

590
00:20:36,414 --> 00:20:37,848
I'm a porno actor.

591
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:46,255
Really?
Oh, my God.

592
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:49,758
Hey.
How you doing?

593
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,627
Hey.
How you doing?

594
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,762
Hello.

595
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:55,297
Hi.
Hi.

596
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,798
How are you?
How are you?

597
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:59,534
All right,
we'll see you later.

598
00:21:03,604 --> 00:21:05,772
He's the phone man.

599
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,044
Not that there's anything
wrong with that.

600
00:21:21,486 --> 00:21:23,822
I am not gay.

601
00:21:23,855 --> 00:21:27,425
I am, however,
thin, single and neat.

602
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,627
Sometimes if someone's thin,
single and neat,

603
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,029
people assume they are gay,
because that is the stereotype.

604
00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:33,696
You normally don't think
of gay people

605
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,532
as fat, sloppy and married.

606
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:36,933
Although I'm sure there are.

607
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:39,635
I don't want to
perpetuate the stereotype.

608
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:40,969
I'm sure they're the minority,
though,

609
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:42,371
within the gay community.

610
00:21:42,404 --> 00:21:44,539
Probably discriminated against.

611
00:21:44,572 --> 00:21:45,974
Because of that,
people say to them,

612
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:47,775
"You know, Joe,
I enjoy being gay with you,

613
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:49,777
"but it's about time, you know,
you got in shape,

614
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,362
tucked your shirt in,
and lost the wife."

615
00:21:50,362 --> 00:21:53,147
tucked your shirt in,
and lost the wife."

616
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,648
But if people
are going to assume

617
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,283
that people that are neat
are gay,

618
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,884
maybe instead of doing this:

619
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,686
"You know, I think Joe
might be a little..."

620
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,786
They should vacuum.

621
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,155
"You know,
I think Joe might be..."

[IMITATES VACUUM]

623
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,024
Yeah.

624
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,037
"I got a feeling
he's a little..."
