00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:12,866
Oh, that's very sweet
of you.

182
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,333
You know, you better
be careful.

183
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:16,000
You don't wanna get
too congenial.

184
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:18,000
They'll slap that
Miss Congeniality on you.

185
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:21,266
You'll congenial yourself
right out of the contest.

186
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:25,700
So, what time you wanna
get together later?

187
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,700
What?

188
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:29,833
So what? We don't need
the chaperone.

189
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:31,700
The chaperone can't make it.

190
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, you're not gonna
get disqualified.

191
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,400
So we're not going?

192
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,582
Come on--
Hold on a minute.

193
00:06:40,582 --> 00:06:40,966
Come on--
Hold on a minute.

194
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,300
Hey, what are you
doing tonight?

195
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,800
Nothing.

196
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,466
I'm going out with one of
the Miss America contestants.

197
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,466
You wanna go?

198
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,833
What state?

199
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,633
Rhode Island.

200
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,633
They're never in contention.

201
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,133
How do you know?

202
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,133
Because I've seen every
Miss America pageant

203
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,500
since I was 6.

204
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:04,666
Look, do you want to go or not?
I'll buy you dinner.

205
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,700
Giddy up.

206
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:07,500
I think I got someone.

207
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,433
The resemblance is uncanny.

208
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,300
Even the brown eyes.

209
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,233
Well, a lot of people have
brown eyes.

210
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:25,466
No, there's something else.

211
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,566
An indefinable quality.

212
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,566
Grace?

213
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,400
Grace, yes.

214
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:36,566
You think <i>I</i> have grace?

215
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,400
Some grace, yes.

216
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:40,133
Just some?

217
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:40,582
Well, you don't want
too much grace,

218
00:07:40,582 --> 00:07:41,900
Well, you don't want
too much grace,

219
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:43,233
or you won't be able
to stand.

220
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:45,900
[LAUGHS]

221
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,166
Oh, Mr. Pitt.

222
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,166
Elaine,

223
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,400
I want you to come
and work for me

224
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:54,866
as my personal assistant.

225
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,733
Now, I'll pay you the same
as Pendant,

226
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:59,733
but I would need you
to start right away.

227
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,866
Hey, Buck, talk to you
for a second?

228
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,800
Sure, George.

229
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,582
How's everything going?
Everything okay?

230
00:08:10,582 --> 00:08:10,700
How's everything going?
Everything okay?

231
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,700
Well, you know,
all of a sudden

232
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:15,200
there's a problem with
Tartabull's swing but--

233
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:20,300
Listen, Buck, obviously
I don't need to talk to you

234
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,533
about the importance of
player morale,

235
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:25,133
but I've been talking to
some of the guys.

236
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,300
And some of them--

237
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,866
I don't wanna mention
any names--

238
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,066
But some of them
are not too happy

239
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,533
with the polyester uniforms.

240
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:33,866
How so?

241
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,166
Well, they get very hot
in the polyester.

242
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,833
You know, it's not
a natural fiber.

243
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:40,582
I think they would
prefer cotton.

244
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:41,333
I think they would
prefer cotton.

245
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:43,500
Cotton, huh?

246
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,666
Cotton breathes.

247
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,066
It's much softer.

248
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,333
Imagine playing games
and your team is five degrees

249
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:51,666
cooler than the other team.

250
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,500
Don't you think that would be
an advantage?

251
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,366
They're cooler.
They're more comfortable.

252
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,166
They're happier.
They're gonna play better.

253
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,833
Maybe you got
something there, George.

254
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:02,166
Oh, I've got something.

255
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,433
Hmm, cotton uniforms?

256
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,733
JERRY:
Congratulations.

257
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:10,166
Yeah, and the best part is
I still get to

258
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,582
look for work
in publishing.

259
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:11,833
look for work
in publishing.

260
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:13,666
Now, what is it
that you do exactly?

261
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,333
I attend to his
personal affairs.

262
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:18,633
Like what?

263
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,866
Well, like tomorrow,
for example, I--

264
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,300
I have to buy him some socks.

265
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,300
Really?

266
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,300
Socks?

267
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,533
Yeah.

268
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:30,666
White ones. Like the ones
you wear with sneakers.

269
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
Hey, maybe you can pick me
up some underwear.

270
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,466
Ahh. So?

271
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,466
What do you think?
Does this work?

272
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,582
Listen, tonight, after
we finish eating?

273
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:41,466
Listen, tonight, after
we finish eating?

274
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,800
You make like you got
something else to do,

275
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,466
and just recede into the night,
if you know what I mean.

276
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,966
No way.

277
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,466
What?

278
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,466
Look, if you think
I'm just gonna step aside

279
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,300
and do nothing
while you defile this woman,

280
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,500
you're crazy.

281
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:56,366
I'm not going to defile her.
That's right.

282
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,233
Because I'm gonna see
it doesn't happen.

283
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:00,800
Look, Jerry, these girls
are Miss America contestants.

284
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,166
It's every little girl's dream.

285
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,133
And I'm not gonna let you
trample that dream

286
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,500
and make a mockery of everything
the pageant stands for.

287
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,500
But--
Ahhh!

288
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,566
No buts.

289
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,566
Those are my rules.

290
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,833
But wait a minute--

291
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:14,066
If you wanna go out and have
some good, wholesome fun

292
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,566
with a nice girl,
I'll help you out.

293
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,566
If you're looking for
something more than that,

294
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,133
you got the wrong guy, buddy.

295
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,733
It's just--
Ahhh!

296
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:22,866
BOTH:
Ahhh!

297
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,500
If you were Miss America,
what would you do

298
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:30,300
to make the world
a better place?

299
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,800
As Miss America,

300
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:37,300
I would try and bring
an end to world hunger.

301
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,700
If every person
sacrificed one meal a week,

302
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:40,582
there would be enough
to feed the whole world.

303
00:10:40,582 --> 00:10:43,033
there would be enough
to feed the whole world.

304
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,033
That's a hell of a plan.
Listen--

305
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:47,200
What advice would you give
young people?

306
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,733
All right, Kramer--

307
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:50,033
This is important stuff.

308
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,966
She's gotta be able to answer
these questions.

309
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,966
She's not gonna have time
to think out there,

310
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,700
with millions of people
watching her.

311
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:58,033
Any hesitation
could cost her the crown.

312
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,233
You know, poise counts.

313
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:01,133
You really know a lot
about this, don't you?

314
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,733
Oh, yeah. Last year, Miss Texas
should have won easily,

315
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:06,200
but she lost points
in the swimsuit competition.

316
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,366
What could she have done?

317
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,066
Tape her breasts together.

318
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:15,033
What else?

319
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,533
Take you, for example.
Now, you're very attractive,

320
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:18,633
but you got a big waist.

321
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,633
Hey, come on.

322
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,500
No, it's okay.

323
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:22,666
Go on.

324
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,900
Well, I'd recommend
a waist cincher.

325
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:26,900
Really?

326
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,066
Oh, yeah, just:

327
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,500
Suck you in.

328
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,400
All right,
I'll be right back.

329
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:36,200
So, what's your talent?

330
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:37,900
Magic.
Mmm.

331
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:40,500
I'm thinking of a number
from one to 10.

332
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:40,582
Six.

333
00:11:40,582 --> 00:11:42,333
Six.

334
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:44,066
No. Five.

335
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,233
But you were close.

336
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:48,333
ANNOUNCER 1:
<i>And the Yankees</i> <i>take the field.</i>

337
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:49,866
ANNOUNCER 2:
<i>Is it my imagination,</i>

338
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,066
<i>or do the Yankees look</i>
<i>a little different tonight?</i>

339
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,533
<i>I can't put my finger</i>
<i>on it.</i>

340
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:54,833
<i>Well, from what</i>
<i>I understand,</i>

341
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:56,900
<i>they've switched</i>
<i>to cotton uniforms.</i>

342
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:59,333
<i>They say</i>
<i>it's softer--</i>

343
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:01,533
<i>Well, it is</i>
<i>a natural fiber.</i>

344
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,800
KRAMER:
What color is your evening?

345
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,500
I'm wearing this red--

346
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:08,866
Stop right there.

347
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,966
No good?
Disaster.

348
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,582
Why?

349
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:10,966
Why?

350
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,633
Well, you got brown eyes.

351
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,300
You wanna wear a green dress.

352
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,466
That makes sense.

353
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,200
Well, here we are.

354
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,633
Kramer,

355
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,000
would you consider
being my personal consultant

356
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:27,300
for the pageant?

357

No, you don't understand.

It's not what you think.
It was an accident.
