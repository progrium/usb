is get the bugs

00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:00,589
My ankle's all bitten up.

180
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:02,722
You got a dog?

181
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,822
No.

182
00:06:07,222 --> 00:06:09,055
Well, that is
strange.

183
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:10,922
How can I have fleas?

184
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:12,167
Don't sweat it, buddy.

185
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:12,255
Don't sweat it, buddy.

186
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,889
I used to have fleas.

187
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:15,089
What did you do
about them?

188
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:16,322
What do you mean?

189
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:18,789
Hey, Jerry!
Hey!

190
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:20,722
How you doing?
Kramer.

191
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,722
Hi, Jerry.

192
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:23,722
What's wrong?

193
00:06:23,755 --> 00:06:24,889
Nothing.

194
00:06:24,922 --> 00:06:27,189
Jerry, I'm your mother.
Now, what is it?

195
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:30,389
Mom, Dad...I have fleas.

196
00:06:32,455 --> 00:06:33,689
ELAINE:
Hey, Paula.

197
00:06:33,722 --> 00:06:35,889
I hear you've been
going out with George Costanza.

198
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:37,355
How did you know?

199
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:39,522
Everybody knows.

200
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:41,022
You know, George
told me he thinks

201
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:42,167
you're totally cute
and everything.

202
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:42,689
you're totally cute
and everything.

203
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:45,255
He said that?
Yep.

204
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,455
Do you like George?

205
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,455
Yeah. He's cool.

206
00:06:50,222 --> 00:06:55,755
No, I mean...do you like him
or do you "like him" like him?

207
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:57,222
"Like" like.

208
00:06:57,255 --> 00:06:59,389
Looks aren't that
important to me, you know?

209
00:06:59,422 --> 00:07:02,055
Ms. Benes...
are you chewing gum?

210
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:08,722
I'm sorry.

211
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:18,955
Yep. They're in your
bedroom too, Mr. Seinfeld.

212
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:22,122
You got a full-blown
outbreak of fleas on your hands.

213
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:23,622
I don't get it.
How did this happen?

214
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:25,189
I don't have a dog.

215
00:07:25,222 --> 00:07:27,455
I don't explain them,
Mr. Seinfeld.

216
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,022
I just exterminate them.

217
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:31,889
I don't
understand this.

218
00:07:31,922 --> 00:07:33,455
I'm gonna have to
seal the place up

219
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:34,589
for 48 hours and fog it.

220
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,222
That's the only way
to get rid of them.

221
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,055
Nobody can be in here
for 48 hours?

222
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:39,455
I got my parents
in town.

223
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:42,167
Well, unless you
wanna kill them...

224
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:42,955
Well, unless you
wanna kill them...

225
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:45,222
they can't stay in here.

226
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:47,455
This stuff is pretty toxic.

227
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:49,122
I'll go get my stuff.
It's in the truck.

228
00:07:49,155 --> 00:07:50,155
Okay.

229
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:53,955
How you doing?
Hi.

230
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:55,922
Bug guy.

231
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:58,522
Why do you have
a bug guy?

232
00:07:58,555 --> 00:07:59,622
I have fleas.

233
00:07:59,655 --> 00:08:02,255
Ugh! Fleas?

234
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:03,255
How did you get fleas?

235
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:04,422
I don't know.

236
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:05,789
But everyone's
gotta clear out

237
00:08:05,822 --> 00:08:07,189
of the apartment
for two days.

238
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:09,189
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with my parents.

239
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,755
They'll never let me
pay for a hotel.

240
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,167
And if they go someplace
on their own,

241
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:12,389
And if they go someplace
on their own,

242
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:13,889
I'm sure it'll be
some awful dump.

243
00:08:13,922 --> 00:08:16,055
Wait a second. Have you
checked into the Plaza yet?

244
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:17,722
No.

245
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:18,722
Oh, no.

246
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:19,789
Come on,
come on, come on.

247
00:08:19,822 --> 00:08:22,589
No, no, no, no, no!
Come on! Come on!

248
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:23,889
All right!

249
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:25,255
Good.

250
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:27,355
[BUZZ]

251
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:28,422
Yeah?

252
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:29,755
GEORGE:
<i>Yeah.</i> Good.

253
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:30,755
Well, what about you?

254
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:32,189
Where are you gonna stay?

255
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:33,755
I don't know.
I'm gonna ask Shelly.

256
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:37,689
But she still might be
upset about the masticated pecan incident.

257
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:40,622
Hey, I found out from
Paula. She likes George.

258
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:42,055
I bet he'll
be relieved.

259
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:42,167
Yeah. When he's dead,
he'll be relieved.

260
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,922
Yeah. When he's dead,
he'll be relieved.

261
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:46,522
Oh, by the way, Viking Press

262
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:48,022
sent a Fed Ex for you
to my parents.

263
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:49,355
They brought it with them.

264
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:51,422
Yeah, that's just
some stuff about the company.

265
00:08:53,922 --> 00:08:55,289
Hey. Hey, did you
talk to Paula?

266
00:08:55,322 --> 00:08:56,689
Yeah.

267
00:08:56,722 --> 00:08:57,722
So, what did she say?

268
00:08:57,755 --> 00:09:00,722
She likes you.

269
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:02,022
She said she liked me.

270
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:03,389
You're kidding?
She said that?

271
00:09:03,422 --> 00:09:04,389
Yeah.

272
00:09:04,422 --> 00:09:05,555
Those were her exact words?

273
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:06,855
"I like George."

274
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:07,855
Yep.

275
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:08,855
Ha-ha!

276
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:09,855
How do you like that?

277
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:11,055
Jerry, How do you
like that?

278
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:12,167
You see. I get myself
into a tizzy.

279
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:12,955
You see. I get myself
into a tizzy.

280
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:15,089
I'm all worked up.
And for what?

281
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,355
For nothing.

282
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,555
She said looks weren't even
that important to her.

283
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:20,055
You see--
What?

284
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:25,989
Uh-oh.

285
00:09:27,255 --> 00:09:28,689
She said--

286
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:31,922
She said looks aren't
that important to her?

287
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:34,422
Let me rephrase that.

288
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:36,355
She thinks I'm ugly.

289
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:37,389
I knew it.

290
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:41,522
Well, see, the thing of it is.
You know, there's a lot

291
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:42,167
of ugly people out there walking
around, but they don't know

292
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,089
of ugly people out there walking
around, but they don't know

293
00:09:44,122 --> 00:09:46,989
they're ugly, because
nobody actually tells them.

294
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,855
So, what's your point?

295
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:52,189
I don't know.
Okay.

296
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:57,022
The point, George,
is she likes you.

297
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,355
Oh, so what.

298
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,122
I'd rather she hate me
and thought I was good-looking.

299
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:03,122
Then at least I could get
somebody else.

300
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:06,789
What is this?
Why am I itching?

301
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:08,322
That would be
the fleas.

302
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:15,555
Hey.
Hey, how do you like this? Ha-ha.

303
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:19,922
Oh, my God.
Morty, let's go.

304
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:22,289
This is too nice.

305
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:25,122
Hey. This is the kind
of room Sinatra stays in.

306
00:10:25,155 --> 00:10:26,522
Hey.

307
00:10:26,555 --> 00:10:28,955
Look, macadamia nuts.

308
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:30,555
Macadamia nuts?

309
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:31,955
Yeah, you know
what these cost?

310
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:33,222
They're like
80 cents a nut.

311
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:35,855
Jerry, are you sure
this is all right?

312
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:37,355
Yeah, it's all
taken care of.

313
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:40,555
MORTY:
Hey! They got a phone in the john here!

314
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:45,122
Judy?

315
00:10:45,155 --> 00:10:46,422
Hey!

316
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:48,855
Hi. Thank you so much for
recommending me to Viking Press.

317
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:50,222
It is my pleasure.

318
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:52,722
Just make sure
you give that manuscript a good read.

319
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:54,022
Manuscript?

320
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:56,455
Yeah, I'm sure they FedExed
you a manuscript.

321
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,922
They want to see
that you can read

322
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:00,422
an unpublished work
and give insightful criticism.

323
00:11:00,455 --> 00:11:01,689
Oh.

324
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:03,089
Read it twice
if you have to.

325
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:06,122
This is a big step
in your career.

326
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:07,689
Yeah. I gotta go.

327
00:11:07,722 --> 00:11:08,689
Hey, what about
lunch?

328
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:09,722
I gotta go.

329
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:12,167
Thank God I found you.

330
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:13,389
Thank God I found you.

331
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,389
Oh, hey!

332
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:15,689
Do you still have
that FedEx?

333
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:17,289
Yeah, I got it.
It's in the apartment.

334
00:11:17,322 --> 00:11:19,289
But we can't go in there.
It's being fumigated.

335
00:11:19,322 --> 00:11:20,389
No, I'll take
my chances.

336
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:21,422
Come on.
Come on.

337
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:24,255
JERRY:
You see.

338
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:26,722
Jerry, I need
that FedEx right now.

339
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:28,255
I told you
to take it.

340
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:31,222
I didn't know that it was
a manuscript that I had to read.

341
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:32,389
Well, you can't
go in there.

342
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:34,655
It's like a gas
chamber in there.

343
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:37,555
Hey.

344
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:39,689
I left a Mackinaw peach
in your refrigerator.

345
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:42,167
Kramer, they're fumigating.
There's toxic gas in there.

346
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:42,789
Kramer, they're fumigating.
There's toxic gas in there.

347
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:45,222
Toxic gas?

348
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:47,255
Oh, you'll be fine.
You were there a few minutes?

349
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,522
An hour and a half!

350
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:52,089
I was reading a manuscript.
I just couldn't put it down.

351
00:11:52,122 --> 00:11:53,122
My manuscript?

352
00:11:53,155 --> 00:11:54,255
How do you feel?

353
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:57,389
Now that you mention it,
a little woozy.
