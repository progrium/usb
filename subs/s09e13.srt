dating a-- A lady Jerry.

00:07:48,997 --> 00:07:51,164
What's the decision?

207
00:07:51,197 --> 00:07:53,597
I know you want me
to keep my big mouth shut.

208
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,497
Well, that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

I'm never gonna talk again.
Yeah, right.

00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,164

to talk for, huh?

211
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:01,597
What, to blab
to the neighbors

212
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,297
about how George has
a new fem-Jerry friend?

213
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,297
Or to tell everybody
at the coffee shop

214
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,497
how George is all mixed up
in a perverse sexual amalgam

00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,564
of some girl
and his best friend?

216

It's a slice of life.

520
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:11,185
Hey, you're Jerry's friend.
You're kooky. Mind if I sit?

521
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:13,351
My show is going really well.
Have you seen it yet?

522
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:13,828
You should.
Everybody else in town has.

523
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:15,385
You should.
Everybody else in town has.

524
00:20:15,418 --> 00:20:17,518
Oh, you know what?
I got recognized the other day.

525
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:18,685
How weird is that?
I know.

526
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,185
At first,
I liked the attention,

527
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:22,418
then after a while, it's like,
take three steps back.

528
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:23,551
Get a life, okay?

529
00:20:23,585 --> 00:20:25,185
But there wouldn't be
a Sally Weaver

530
00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:26,851
without the fans,
you know what I mean?

531
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:29,018
But who am I anyway?
There's Sally Weaver the woman,

532
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:31,218
Sally Weaver the artist,
Sally Weaver the person--

533
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:33,251
You know, you gotta shut up.

534
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:38,585
I'm sorry. I--
I haven't spoken in days.

535
00:20:38,618 --> 00:20:41,618
Well, lay it on me,
string bean.

JANET:
Let me get this gum out of my hair

537
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:43,828
and then I'll be ready
for bed.

538
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:46,118
and then I'll be ready
for bed.

539
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:49,418
Okay, look, the gum
isn't cutting it for me.

540
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:51,618
We need to be
about something else.

541
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:54,018
Anything, please.

JANET:
George...

544
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:00,585
Your hair.

545
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:01,918
Well, I had to cut
the gum out,

546
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:04,785
and I had a little trouble
getting it even.

547
00:21:04,818 --> 00:21:07,085
So why don't you
get undressed, George?

548
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:11,385
George is in weird trouble!

JERRY:
You ripped off a "Ziggy"?

552
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:20,518
It must have seeped
into my subconscious.

553
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:23,385
Puddy has
"Ziggy" bed sheets.

554
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:27,418
Did you read
the comics today?

555
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:30,618
Oh, I see Ziggy's back
at the complaint department.

Hey, lookit,

561
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:41,751
Sally's cable show is on.

Hey-- Hey, Kramer, come on in.
You're gonna watch this.

This will be funny.
Now she's got nothing.

00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:53,418
That's right, sister.
Why don't you just give up?

568
00:21:53,451 --> 00:21:55,851
Why are you yelling
at the TV?

Elaine, have you
been talking to her?

574
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:06,885
Hey, I'm just a fan.

575
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:08,251

you stopped talking.

All right, starting now.

580
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:32,233
You broke up with her
because she cut her hair?

581
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,467
How short?

582
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,100
Like that.

583
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:37,367
You mean, like--?

584
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,300
That.

585
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,400
So she--
Yes.

586
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:42,467
And you don't--
No.

587
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,267
So--
Exactly.

588
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:47,033
Hm.

589
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,267
We must never

590
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,300
ever speak of this again.

591
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,433
No, no.

Hey, you--? You want
to go see a movie?

Actually, I think
I'm gonna take a few days off.
