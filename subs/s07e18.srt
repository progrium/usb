The other thing I love

2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,003
is when you're
in the middle of a dream

3
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:05,369
and your alarm goes off,

4
00:00:05,403 --> 00:00:08,536
you incorporate the sound
of the alarm into the dream

5
00:00:08,569 --> 00:00:10,336
so you can keep sleeping.

6
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:13,203
And you'll make any adjustment
in the dream to do it.

00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:16,036
I was with Marie Antoinette
in a dream last night,

8
00:00:16,069 --> 00:00:18,536
and she was on the guillotine,
the blade came down,

9
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:20,703
her head fell in the basket,
it rolled over,

10
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:24,469
and she started singing
Neil Diamond's "Solitary Man."

11
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:28,869
And I thought,
"That is not my alarm going off.

12
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,000
This is actually happening."
