00:14:09,103 --> 00:14:11,669
Hi Kramer, guess what.
I just saw Bryant Gumbel.

355
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:13,803
He said he might help out
at the benefit.

356
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:15,036
Great.

357
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:23,236
What is that?

358
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,703
It's the puffy shirt.

359
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:25,903
Look at it.

360
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:29,203
What do you think?
Is it cool or what?

361
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,869
Why are you wearing this now?

362
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,536
Why am I wearing it now?

363
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:34,536
I'll tell you why
I'm wearing it now.

364
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:37,536
Because the low-talker asked
me to, that's why.

365
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:39,203
And I said yes.

366
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:40,203
Do you know why?

367
00:14:40,236 --> 00:14:42,403
Because I couldn't hear her.

368
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:45,705
When did she--?
When did she ask you this?

369
00:14:45,705 --> 00:14:46,203
When did she--?
When did she ask you this?

370
00:14:46,236 --> 00:14:47,203
When we were at dinner,

371
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:48,636
and Kramer went
to the bathroom.

372
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:49,969
I didn't hear anything--

373
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:51,203
Of course not.

374
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:53,703
Nobody hears anything
when this woman speaks!

375
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:56,369
Well, you can't wear that
on the show.

376
00:14:56,403 --> 00:14:57,536
Elaine, you want to stuff it?

377
00:14:57,569 --> 00:14:59,703
Wha--?
What? No.

378
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:01,636
Jerry, you are promoting
a benefit,

379
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:04,736
to clothe homeless-people.

380
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:10,069
You can't come out
dressed like that.

381
00:15:10,103 --> 00:15:12,803
You're all puffed up.

382
00:15:12,836 --> 00:15:15,669
You look like
the Count of Monte Cristo.

383
00:15:15,703 --> 00:15:15,705
I have to wear it,

384
00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:17,003
I have to wear it,

385
00:15:17,036 --> 00:15:18,569
The woman has orders
for this shirt,

386
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:20,569
based on me
wearing it on TV!

387
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:22,669
They're producing them
as we speak.

388
00:15:22,703 --> 00:15:25,736
Yeah, but you're supposed to be
a compassionate person,

389
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:27,836
that cares
about poor people.

390
00:15:27,869 --> 00:15:31,203
You look like you're gonna
swing in on a chandelier.

391
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:34,269
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

392
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:37,169
Okay. Let's go.

393
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:40,236
Is that what
you're wearing?

394
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:45,403
I've never seen hands
like these before.

395
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:45,705
You're so soft
and milky white.

396
00:15:45,705 --> 00:15:48,136
You're so soft
and milky white.

397
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:50,503
You know whose hands
they remind me of?

398
00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:53,303
Ray McKigney.

399
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:54,636
Oh! Ray.

400
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:56,136
He was it.

401
00:15:56,169 --> 00:15:57,969
Who was he?

402
00:15:58,003 --> 00:16:00,369
The most exquisite hands
you've ever seen.

403
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:01,803
Oh, he had it all.

404
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,903
What happened
to him?

405
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:11,469
Tragic story,
I'm afraid.

406
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:14,669
He could've had
any woman in the world,

407
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:15,705
but none could match
the beauty of his own hand.

408
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:18,803
but none could match
the beauty of his own hand.

409
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:21,936
And that became
his one true love.

410
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:28,569
You mean, uh--?

411
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:30,169
Yes.

412
00:16:30,203 --> 00:16:33,169
He was not
master of his domain.

413
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:39,236
But how--?

414
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:43,003
The muscles became
so strained with overuse,

415
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,705
that eventually the hand locked
into a deformed position,

416
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:46,569
that eventually the hand locked
into a deformed position,

417
00:16:46,603 --> 00:16:48,736
and he was left with nothing
but a claw.

418
00:16:49,836 --> 00:16:52,569
He traveled the world
seeking a cure:

419
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:54,569
acupuncturists,

420
00:16:54,603 --> 00:16:55,736
herbalists,

421
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:57,336
swamis.

422
00:16:57,369 --> 00:16:58,903
Nothing helped.

423
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:01,236
Towards the end,

424
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:03,403
his hands became so frozen,

425
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:05,536
he was unable
to manipulate utensils,

426
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:09,903
and was dependent
on cub scouts to feed him.

427
00:17:09,936 --> 00:17:11,503
I hadn't seen
another pair of hands,

428
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:14,636
like Ray McKigney's,
until today.

429
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:15,705
You are his successor.

430
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:16,569
You are his successor.

431
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:21,103
I, uh, only hope you have
a little more self-control.

432
00:17:25,236 --> 00:17:28,169
You don't have to worry
about me.

433
00:17:28,203 --> 00:17:29,903
I won a contest.

434
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:38,736
Okay,
let's get to work.

435
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:45,705
On Tuesday the 19th
here in New York,

436
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:46,236
On Tuesday the 19th
here in New York,

437
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:48,469
there'll be a benefit
for the Goodwill Industries,

438
00:17:48,503 --> 00:17:49,736
a used clothing organization,

439
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,536
that provides services
to the needy.

440
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:54,303
One of the performers will be
comedian Jerry Seinfeld.

441
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:56,036
Jerry, good morning.
Thank you, Brian.

442
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:57,869
And speaking of clothing,

443
00:17:57,903 --> 00:18:00,836
that is a very, very
unusual shirt you have on.

444
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:02,503
Uh-huh, yeah.

445
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:07,369
You're all kind of puffed up.

446
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:09,403
Yes, it's a puffy shirt.

447
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:12,169
You look like a pirate.

448
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:13,503
Like a pirate.

449
00:18:13,536 --> 00:18:15,003
Anyway, uh, you know,

450
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:15,705
we're hoping to raise
enough money--

451
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:17,503
we're hoping to raise
enough money--

452
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:18,703
You know, you know--

453
00:18:18,736 --> 00:18:19,703
Look, I'm sorry,

454
00:18:19,736 --> 00:18:21,669
it is just a very unusual shirt.

455
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:23,336
It could become
a whole new look for you.

456
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,169
You know, you could put
a patch over an eye,

457
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:26,903
You could kinda be
the pirate comedian--

458
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:28,003
Uh-huh, yeah.

459
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:31,469
You gonna be wearing
the puffy shirt at the--?

460
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:32,469
Look, it's not my shirt.

461
00:18:32,503 --> 00:18:33,669
Whose shirt is--?

462
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:34,669
What's the difference?

463
00:18:34,703 --> 00:18:36,469
I agreed to wear it.

464
00:18:36,503 --> 00:18:39,669
It's a puffy shirt,
I feel ridiculous in it.

465
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,069
And I think it's the stupidest
shirt I've ever seen,

466
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:43,503
to be perfectly honest with you.

467
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:45,705
LESLIE:
You bastard!

468
00:18:45,705 --> 00:18:46,169
LESLIE:
You bastard!

469
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:47,536
Did you hear that?

470
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:49,436
That I heard.

471
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:54,369
All right.
A little to the left.

472
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:56,303
Little higher.
Good, Perfect.

473
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,569
Like that?
Just like that. Hold it.

474
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:01,236
Okay, let me get one more.

475
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:02,969
Good. That's it.

476
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:03,969
You're done.

477
00:19:04,003 --> 00:19:05,003
That's it?

478
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:06,503
That's it.

479
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:08,503
And here's your check.

480
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:09,803
Thank you very much.

481
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:10,836
It was an honor.

482
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:12,436
Thank you.

483
00:19:17,003 --> 00:19:19,003
It was great
working with you.

484
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:20,569
Your hands
are beautiful.

485
00:19:20,603 --> 00:19:21,803
Oh.

486
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:23,936
Thank you very much.

487
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:26,569
You know, I was wondering,

488
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:28,403
if you're not doing
anything later,

489
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:30,503
maybe you'd
like to get together.

490
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:39,669
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

491
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:44,736
You ruined me,
you ruined my career!

492
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:45,705
Just keep your voice down.
Everyone can hear you.

493
00:19:45,705 --> 00:19:47,403
Just keep your voice down.
Everyone can hear you.

494
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,003
I don't give a damn!

495
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:51,003
You know, if you talked
this loud to begin with,

496
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:53,069
I wouldn't be in this costume
in the first place.

497
00:19:53,103 --> 00:19:54,536
Hey, hey, you can't
believe this.

498
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,136
Look at this check.
They told me I had

499
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:58,569
the most beautiful hands
they've ever seen in their life,

500
00:19:58,603 --> 00:19:59,869
except for this McKigney guy.

501
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:02,036
This great-looking girl
gave me her phone number.

502
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:04,636
I got it all!
I'm busting, Jerry. I'm busting!

503
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:06,969
Hey, I've never noticed
your hands before, let me see.

504
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:08,336
All right.

505
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:11,369
Yeah. Real nice.

506
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:17,269
Nice shirt.

507
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:21,036
Wh-what is this?

508
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:22,469
Is this what you wore
on the show?

509
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:23,469
Yeah.

510
00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:25,736
Have you completely
lost your mind?

511
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:27,536
Who's dressing you?

512
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:30,036
You look like
a complete idiot.

513
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:31,603
I wouldn't wipe my--

514
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:33,669
Aah!

516
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:42,603
You ready?
Yeah.

517
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:47,336
Hot, hot!

518
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:48,836
Hot!

519
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:50,703
ELAINE:
I'm sorry.

520
00:20:50,736 --> 00:20:53,903
This McKigney guy had
a few good years.

521
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:56,169
How could you forget
to turn off an iron?

522
00:20:56,203 --> 00:20:58,903
I was excited because Jerry
was putting on the puffy shirt.

523
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:01,669
My whole life is ruined
because of the puffy shirt.

524
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:03,236
It didn't do
me any good either.

525
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:05,869
That benefit was the worst show
I ever did.

526
00:21:05,903 --> 00:21:08,369
Some of those heckles
were really uncalled-for.

527
00:21:08,403 --> 00:21:09,836
"Avast ye, matey"?

528
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,869
What the hell
does that mean?

00:21:13,703 --> 00:21:14,869
it's a Spanish galleon."

531
00:21:14,903 --> 00:21:15,705
There's no comeback
for that.

532
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:17,069
There's no comeback
for that.

533
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:20,736
Well, it got me fired
from the benefit committee.

534
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:23,836
You know, all those stores
canceled out on her.

535
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:25,003
She's finished.

536
00:21:25,036 --> 00:21:26,369
We're finished.

537
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:28,003
Really?
What happened?

538
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,369
I just can't be with someone,

539
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:32,369
whose life is in
complete disarray.

540
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,803
What happened to
all the shirts?

541
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,003
They gave them
to Goodwill.

542
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:41,836
GEORGE:
Puffy shirt, puffy shirt!

543
00:21:46,336 --> 00:21:50,103
Can you spare a little change,
for an old buccaneer?

544
00:21:52,003 --> 00:21:53,969
You know, it's really not
a bad-looking shirt.

545
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:56,669
[♪]

546
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:09,303
Why do we always
have to say "excuse me,"

547
00:22:09,336 --> 00:22:11,669
when we can't hear
what someone is saying?

548
00:22:11,703 --> 00:22:13,636
Why are we so guilty?

549
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:16,536
"Excuse me. Pardon me.
I'm sorry."

550
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,236
Why can't just once, I go,

551
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:20,303
"Nope. Not loud enough"?

552
00:22:20,336 --> 00:22:22,003
Why can't I do that?

553
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:24,336
[♪]

554
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:27,336
Just once I would like to have
the guts,

555
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:29,503
you know, to make that judgment.

556
00:22:29,536 --> 00:22:31,169
Someone mumbles something
and you go,

557
00:22:31,203 --> 00:22:32,803
"Your fault."

558
00:22:32,836 --> 00:22:34,448
"I'm not sorry
because it's your fault."

559
00:22:34,448 --> 00:22:36,169
"I'm not sorry
because it's your fault."
