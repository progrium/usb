1
00:00:00,707 --> 00:00:04,674
To me, government is basically
parents for adults.

2
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:06,649
Especially the IRS.

3
00:00:06,682 --> 00:00:08,815
The IRS is like
Ward and June Cleaver,

4
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:12,669
and we're all
Wally and the Beaver.

5
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:14,669
And your accountant
is Eddie Haskell

6
00:00:14,703 --> 00:00:16,169
showing you all these
neat tricks

7
00:00:16,203 --> 00:00:17,769
to get away with stuff.

8
00:00:17,803 --> 00:00:19,769
Which is fine
unless you get audited.

9
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:21,569
Then you don't want
some wise guy in a suit,

10
00:00:21,603 --> 00:00:22,769
just standing there going:

11
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:26,169
"You have a very lovely office
here, sir."

12
00:00:26,203 --> 00:00:28,169
Because jail
is the government's way

13
00:00:28,203 --> 00:00:29,769
of sending you to your room.

14
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:30,000
And when you meet Whitey
and Lumpy in the joint,

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,669
And when you meet Whitey
and Lumpy in the joint,

16
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:37,203
there's really going to be
something wrong with the Beaver.

17
00:00:39,703 --> 00:00:41,569
[â™ª]

18
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:44,592
So, does he like you?
What do you think?

19
00:00:44,626 --> 00:00:46,292
Do you like him?
Yeah, yeah, I like him.

20
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:48,392
Definitely like him.
I like him a lot.

21
00:00:48,426 --> 00:00:49,559
So, what's wrong
with him?

22
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:50,759
Nothing, and I've looked.

23
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:53,592
Well, I'm sure
you'll find something.

24
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:55,559
So, how'd you meet him?
In the office.

25
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:57,559
So, he's a writer?
Yeah.

26
00:00:57,592 --> 00:00:58,792
Yeah, big surprise.

27
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:00,626
So, I was sitting
on the reception desk,

28
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,792
I was looking pretty hot,

29
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:04,626
I was wearing
my sling-back pumps.

30
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:05,826
What are those?

31
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:07,059
Ask your mother.

32
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:08,163
You live with her now,
don't you?

33
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:08,759
You live with her now,
don't you?

34
00:01:08,792 --> 00:01:12,592
Anyway, so then this guy
comes up to me,

35
00:01:12,626 --> 00:01:14,259
and he starts feeling
my jacket,

36
00:01:14,292 --> 00:01:16,792
between his thumb
and his forefinger, like this.

37
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,126
So what'd you do?

38
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,559
I said,
"so, what do you think?"

39
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:20,992
and he said, "Gabardine?"

40
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:24,126
and I said, "yeah."
That was it.

41
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:27,292
Wow. Just felt
your material?

42
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:28,792
Yeah. Jake Jarmel.

43
00:01:28,826 --> 00:01:30,759
Wow. Sounds like
a cool guy.

44
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:31,826
Sounds like a jerk.

45
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,759
"Felt your material,"
come on.

46
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:36,326
Jerry, where'd you get
that sweater?

47
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,163
Yeah, what do you think? I found
it in the back of my closet.

48
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:38,792
Yeah, what do you think? I found
it in the back of my closet.

49
00:01:38,826 --> 00:01:41,992
I think that's what
the back of closets are for.

50
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:43,459
Hey, that's Barry.

51
00:01:43,492 --> 00:01:45,159
Look it. Barry.

52
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,559
Hey. Hi.

53
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:47,826
GEORGE:
Who's that?

54
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,726
That's Barry Prophet.
He's our accountant.

55
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,226
I don't know how you can let
this guy handle all your money.

56
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,626
Oh, he doesn't handle my money,
he handles Jerry's money.

57
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:55,626
He just does my taxes.

58
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:57,126
Hey, Barry.
How you doing?

59
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,626
This is my friend George.

60
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,659
Hi, what are you doing
in this neighborhood?

61
00:02:00,692 --> 00:02:01,892
Nothing, really.

62
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:03,092
[SNIFFING]

63
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:04,492
You eat here?

64
00:02:04,526 --> 00:02:06,259
Yeah. So, how's my money?

65
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,259
It's still green.

66
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:08,163
[SNIFFING]

67
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:08,259
[SNIFFING]

68
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,292
What, you got a cold?

69
00:02:09,326 --> 00:02:10,326
No, no.

70
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:12,426
Wow. Look at that ring.

71
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:14,426
Oh, you like that?

72
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:17,792
Say, uh, where's the bathroom?

73
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:19,959
Bathroom, uh?
Bathroom's right over there.

74
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:21,459
Great.

75
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,059
Did you see that?

76
00:02:24,092 --> 00:02:25,326
See what?

77
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:26,392
Yes, I saw that.

78
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:27,392
What?

79
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:29,092
What was all that sniffing?

80
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:30,259
I don't know.

81
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:31,326
You don't think--?

82
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,092
Oh, no! Come on, Jerry.

83
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:36,159
He was definitely
sniffing.

84
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:38,163
I mean, what if--?

85
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:38,726
I mean, what if--?

86
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,226
This guy's got all my money.

87
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:42,059
Plus I got some
of Kramer's money with him.

88
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:43,659
This guy can write checks
to himself,

89
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:44,659
right out of my account.

90
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:46,226
I have known this guy
since college,

91
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:47,226
He doesn't do drugs.

92
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:48,592
Then what was all that sniffing?

93
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,426
Maybe it's the cold weather.

94
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:51,426
Today's not cold.

95
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:52,592
All right.

96
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:54,792
I gotta get going,
My parents are expecting me.

97
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:58,692
Don't forget to wash your hands
before supper.

98
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:05,826
What do you need
all that ketchup for?

99
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:08,163
This is my ketchup.

100
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:09,826
This is my ketchup.

101
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:11,826
I bought this ketchup,

102
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,359
just so I could have
as much as I wanted.

103
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:21,126
So I talked to
Phil Kassikoff today.

104
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,326
Phil Kassikoff?

105
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:25,126
Yeah. You know,
my friend the bra salesman.

106
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,592
He says they're looking
to maybe put somebody on,

107
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:30,292
so I got you an interview
next Friday with his boss.

108
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:31,926
Next Friday? What time?

109
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,126
2:00.

110
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,826
That's my whole afternoon.

111
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:36,492
I was gonna look for sneakers.

112
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:38,163
You can look for sneakers
the next day!

113
00:03:38,163 --> 00:03:38,659
You can look for sneakers
the next day!

114
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:42,859
He doesn't know
anything about bras.

115
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,826
I know a little.

116
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:50,226
Besides,
what do you have to know?

117
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:51,659
Well, it wouldn't hurt
to go in

118
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,926
and be able to
discuss it intelligently.

119
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,659
Maybe you should take a look
at a few bras.

120
00:03:56,692 --> 00:03:57,759
Where's your bra?

121
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:58,926
Give him a bra
to look at.

122
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,292
I'm not giving him a bra,
Why not?

123
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:04,126
because I don't need him
looking at my bras.

124
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,826
Fine. So he'll go
into the interview--

125
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:07,659
He wouldn't know
what he's talking about.

126
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:08,163
Do we have to...?

127
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:10,059
Do we have to...?

128
00:04:10,092 --> 00:04:12,226
You don't even know
what they're made from.

129
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:13,892
They're made from Lycra spandex.

130
00:04:13,926 --> 00:04:15,959
Get out of here.
Lycra spandex?

131
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:17,826
I think they are made
from Lycra spandex.

132
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,559
Do you wanna bet?
How much you wanna bet?

133
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,259
I'm not betting.
Take a look.

134
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:24,559
All right.
I'll get a bra.

135
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:26,126
I don't know what
the big problem is,

136
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:27,492
getting a bra.

137
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:29,226
She doesn't want to get a bra.

138
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:31,992
I'm not saying go to the library
and read the whole history,

139
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:34,259
but it wouldn't kill you
to know a little bit about it.

140
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:37,026
All right.
It wouldn't kill me.

141
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,759
How long does it take
to find a bra?

142
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,559
What's going on
in there?

143
00:04:44,592 --> 00:04:46,426
You ask me to get
a pair of underwear,

144
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:48,292
I'm back
in two seconds.

145
00:04:48,326 --> 00:04:52,259
You know about the cup sizes
and all?

146
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:55,892
They have different cups.

147
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:58,759
Yeah, I know
about the cups.

148
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:02,992
You got the "A."

149
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:05,892
the "B,"

150
00:05:05,926 --> 00:05:07,892
the "C,"

151
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:08,163
the "D."

152
00:05:08,163 --> 00:05:09,226
the "D."

153
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,459
That's the biggest.

154
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:13,659
I know the "D" is the biggest.

155
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:17,426
I based my whole life on knowing
that the "D" is the biggest.

156
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:18,992
Here. Here's the bra.

157
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:19,992
Let me see it.

158
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:22,759
One hundred percent
Lycra spandex.

159
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,792
Let me see it.
I told you.

160
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:25,792
Here.

161
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,792
You think you know everything.

162
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,826
Huh. That's surprising.

163
00:05:31,926 --> 00:05:33,659
All right, what else?

164
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:36,292
You got the cups in the front,

165
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:37,826
two loops in the back.

166
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:38,163
All right,
I guess that's about it.

167
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:40,092
All right,
I guess that's about it.

168
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:42,792
I got it. Cups in the front,
loops in the back.

169
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:45,092
You got ketchup on it.

170
00:05:51,526 --> 00:05:53,959
Sniffing?
What do you mean, sniff?

171
00:05:53,992 --> 00:05:55,292
Sniffing
with his nose.

172
00:05:55,326 --> 00:05:57,226
Jerry, he probably had a cold.

173
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,592
No, he didn't.
I asked him.

174
00:05:58,626 --> 00:05:59,626
So what are you saying?

175
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,926
I don't know.
You know, what if--?

176
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,459
Drugs?

177
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:04,726
You think he's on drugs?

178
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,926
I don't know.
All I know is he was sniffing.

179
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:08,163
Listen, we went in
on a CD together.

180
00:06:08,163 --> 00:06:09,426
Listen, we went in
on a CD together.

181
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:10,626
I know.

182
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:11,892
And Newman gave you money too.

183
00:06:11,926 --> 00:06:13,292
See, I didn't even meet
this guy.

184
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:14,559
You know. We trusted you.

185
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:16,826
Look, It doesn't necessarily
mean anything yet.

186
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:18,392
It just means he was sniffing.

187
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:20,126
Well, what else?
Was he nervous?

188
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,659
Did he use a lot of slang?

189
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:24,026
Did he use the word "man"?

190
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,459
No, he didn't use "man."

191
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:31,326
I mean, when he was leaving,
did he say, "I'm splittin'"?

192
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,992
No, but at one point,
he did use the bathroom.

193
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:38,163
You think that's a bad sign?

194
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:39,292
You think that's a bad sign?

195
00:06:39,326 --> 00:06:40,659
Yes, yes.
That's what they do.

196
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,126
They live
in the bathroom.

197
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,492
All right,
what are we gonna do?

198
00:06:43,526 --> 00:06:45,259
We're gonna go get
our money back, right?

199
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:46,259
I don't know.

200
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:47,826
This sweater itches me.
You want it?

201
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:49,192
Yeah.

202
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:55,192
Hello? Hel--?

203
00:06:57,526 --> 00:06:59,259
Well, you notice anything?

204
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:02,159
You have cleaned up
the whole apartment

205
00:07:02,192 --> 00:07:03,392
and you're making dinner.

206
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:05,992
You're perfect!
You're a perfect man!

207
00:07:08,192 --> 00:07:10,192
BOTH:
Ohhhhh.

208
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:12,426
Did anyone call?

209
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:14,226
You got a few messages,
I wrote them down.

210
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:15,392
Where are they?

211
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:17,426
Let's see. They are--

212
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,092
Here they are.

213
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:20,759
Thank you.

214
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:23,292
Oh, yeah. Ha.
I'll call you back.

215
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,726
Forget that.

216
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,292
[GASPS]
Myra had the baby!

217
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:29,992
Oh, my god!
That's wonderful!

218
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:31,492
Who called?
She did.

219
00:07:31,526 --> 00:07:34,059
She did?
Oh, that's so great.

220
00:07:34,092 --> 00:07:35,426
Where do you keep the corkscrew?

221
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:37,092
It's in the drawer,
on the right.

222
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,759
Hmm.

223
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,259
What?

224
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:44,759
Nah. It's nothing.

225
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:46,259
No, what is it?

226
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:47,426
It's nothing.

227
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:48,492
Tell me.

228
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:50,759
Well, I was just curious,

229
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:53,759
why you didn't use
an exclamation point.

230
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:57,992
What are you talking about?

231
00:07:58,026 --> 00:07:58,992
Well, see right here?

232
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:00,492
You wrote,
"Myra had the baby,"

233
00:08:00,526 --> 00:08:03,659
but you didn't use
an exclamation point.

234
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,559
So?

235
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:08,059
It's nothing.
Forget it. Forget it.

236
00:08:08,092 --> 00:08:08,163
I just found it curious.

237
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:10,559
I just found it curious.

238
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:12,559
What's so curious
about it?

239
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,326
Well, I mean,

240
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:17,126
if one of your close friends
had a baby,

241
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:18,559
and I left you
a message about it,

242
00:08:18,592 --> 00:08:20,459
I would use
an exclamation point.

243
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:22,592
Well, maybe I don't use
my exclamation points,

244
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:24,126
as haphazardly as you do.

245
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:28,659
You don't think that
someone having a baby

246
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:30,759
warrants an exclamation point?

247
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,659
Hey, look, I just
jotted down the message.

248
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:34,159
I didn't know
that I was required,

249
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:36,292
to capture the mood
of each caller.

250
00:08:36,326 --> 00:08:38,163
I just thought that you'd be
a little more excited,

251
00:08:38,163 --> 00:08:38,992
I just thought that you'd be
a little more excited,

252
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:42,126
about a friend of mine
having a baby.

253
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,459
Okay, I'm excited.

254
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,559
I just don't happen to like
exclamation points.

255
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,626
Well, you know Jake,
you should learn to use 'em.

256
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,126
Like the way I'm talking
right now,

257
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,959
I would put
exclamation points at the ends,

258
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:52,059
of all these sentences!

259
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:54,759
On this one!
And on that one!

260
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,959
You can put one
on this one:

261
00:08:56,992 --> 00:08:58,426
I'm leaving!

262
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:05,792
You're out of your mind,
you know that. Why?

263
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:07,592
It's an exclamation point.

264
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:08,163
It's a line
with a dot under it.

265
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:09,992
It's a line
with a dot under it.

266
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:11,726
Well,
I felt it called for one.

267
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,326
"Called for one." You know, I
thought I'd heard of everything.

268
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,992
I never heard of a relationship
being affected by punctuation.

269
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:20,126
I find it very troubling
that he didn't use one.

270
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,126
George is right.

271
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,959
Didn't take you long.

272
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,592
Anything new
with that guy on drugs?

273
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:31,626
Oh, he's not on drugs.

274
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:32,759
Then why the sniffing?

275
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:35,892
Who walks around...sniffing?

276
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:38,159
All right, here.
You call him right now, okay?

277
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:39,892
See if he's sniffing
right now.

278
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:41,526
Good idea.

279
00:09:44,326 --> 00:09:45,626
<i>[RINGING]</i>

280
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:46,959
<i>Prophet and Goldstein.</i>

281
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:49,159
Yes, I'd like to speak
with Barry Prophet, please.

282
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:50,759
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>he's out of town this week.</i>

283
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:51,892
Out of town?

284
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:53,792
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>He went to South America.</i>

285
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,092
South America?

286
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:56,259
South America?

287
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:57,892
I'll call back.
Thank you.

288
00:09:57,926 --> 00:09:59,759
He went to South America.

289
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:01,259
Yeeahh!

290
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:03,726
So what?

291
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,059
Who goes to South America?

292
00:10:06,092 --> 00:10:07,959
People go to South America.

293
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:08,163
Yeah, and they come back
with things taped to their large intestine.

294
00:10:08,163 --> 00:10:11,426
Yeah, and they come back
with things taped to their large intestine.

295
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,726
So because of a few bad apples,

296
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,992
you're going to impugn
an entire continent?

297
00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:17,892
Yes, I'm impugning
a continent.

298
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:21,092
Well, I say we go
and get our money right now!

299
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:22,459
Hey! Hey! Hey!

300
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:24,326
Hello,
Newman.

301
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:26,726
Hello, Jerry.

302
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,292
So any news?

303
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:30,626
Yeah, he skipped out
and went to South America.

304
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:32,059
South America?

305
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:36,326
What kind of snow-blower
did you get us mixed up with?

306
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:38,163
Okay gentlemen, the fact remains
you still have no proof.

307
00:10:38,163 --> 00:10:39,626
Okay gentlemen, the fact remains
you still have no proof.

308
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:42,126
This is all speculation
and hearsay.

309
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,126
Wait, there's one way
to find out.

310
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,559
We set up a sting.

311
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:47,492
You know, like Abscam.

312
00:10:47,526 --> 00:10:49,326
Like Abscam, Jerry.

313
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:51,592
Oh, what are you going to do?

314
00:10:51,626 --> 00:10:53,592
You're going to put on
phony beards,

315
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:55,459
and dress up like Arab sheiks,

316
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:57,292
and sit around
in some hotel room?

317
00:10:57,326 --> 00:10:58,592
I mean, come on.

318
00:10:58,626 --> 00:10:59,892
Well, wait a second.

319
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,326
Maybe there is a way that
we could tempt him and find out.

320
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:04,159
I'm sure if we put
our three heads together,

321
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:07,792
we should come up
with something.

322
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:14,526
[â™ª]

323
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,175
What's today?

324
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:19,176
It's Thursday.

325
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:20,209
Really?

326
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:22,409
Feels like Tuesday.

327
00:11:23,543 --> 00:11:25,476
Tuesday has no feeling.

328
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:27,509
Monday has a feel.

329
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:29,676
Friday has a feel.

330
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:31,343
Sunday has a feel.

331
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:32,676
I feel Tuesday and Wedn--

332
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,376
All right, shut up,
the both of you.

333
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:36,309
You're making me nervous.

334
00:11:36,343 --> 00:11:39,376
Where is he already?
He should have been out of work by now.

335
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:41,087
You know,
this is kinda fun.

336
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:41,509
You know,
this is kinda fun.

337
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:44,276
Yeah. Maybe we ought to become
private detectives.

338
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:45,709
Maybe you should.

339
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:46,776
Maybe I will.

340
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:49,176
Yeah, me too.

341
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,176
All right,
what are you gonna say to him?

342
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,843
I'm just gonna find out
if he's interested.

343
00:11:53,876 --> 00:11:55,543
Hey, maybe I should go
in with him.

344
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:56,843
No, you stay here in the car.

345
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:57,843
Who made you leader?

346
00:11:57,876 --> 00:11:58,843
All right, Newman.

347
00:11:58,876 --> 00:11:59,843
One more peep out of you,

348
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:01,643
you're outta
the whole operation.

349
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:05,709
There he is.
He's going into that bar.

350
00:12:08,176 --> 00:12:10,176
All right,

351
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:11,087
I'm going in.

352
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:11,309
I'm going in.

353
00:12:11,343 --> 00:12:12,643
Be careful,

530
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:46,143
Oh, no, the letter!

531
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:49,543
Newman, it's got exclamation
points all over it.

532
00:19:49,576 --> 00:19:51,709
Not to mention the picture
of him on the toilet.

533
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:57,976
The what?

534
00:20:08,243 --> 00:20:09,676
After you.

535
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,009
Thank you.

536
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:14,943
Get your hands
off of me!

537
00:20:14,976 --> 00:20:17,409
Johnny! Johnny!

538
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:25,176
What do you mean
you felt her material?

539
00:20:25,209 --> 00:20:26,776
What, with your fingers,
like this?

540
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,309
So what?
What's so bad about that?

541
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:32,043
Who goes around feeling
people's material?

542
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:35,809
What can be gained by feeling
a person's material?

543
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:37,276
It's insanity!

544
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:38,443
Whatever happened to:

545
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:40,276
"My that's a lovely dress
you have on.

546
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:41,087
"May I have this dance?"

547
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,709
"May I have this dance?"

548
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:51,476
You know you are really lucky
Newman never mailed that letter.

549
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:53,143
Sorry I'm late.

550
00:20:53,176 --> 00:20:55,643
I just came from a meeting
with my lawyer.

551
00:20:55,676 --> 00:20:56,976
What is this?

552
00:20:57,009 --> 00:21:01,509
It's a letter from your friend,
Barry Prophet's lawyer.

553
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:03,943
He's filing
chapter 11?

554
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:04,976
What's going on?

555
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:06,209
Why's he filing
chapter 11?

556
00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:07,543
Bankruptcy.

557
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:08,776
Bankruptcy, as in

558
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,876
"I've taken your money
and spent it on drugs."

559
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:11,087
What do you mean?
I thought it was the sweater!

560
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:13,643
What do you mean?
I thought it was the sweater!

561
00:21:13,676 --> 00:21:15,043
All right,
what about the money?

562
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:16,376
What about the money?

563
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,776
Apparently, if I'd dissolved
my relationship with him,

564
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,443
prior to his filing chapter 11,
I could have got the money back.

565
00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:22,509
Which I would have done.

566
00:21:22,543 --> 00:21:23,509
If a certain imbecile,

567
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:25,376
had been able to get
to a mailbox,

568
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,876
and mail a letter.

569
00:21:32,576 --> 00:21:33,876
A pair of bear claws, please.

570
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:41,087
Nice.

571
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:41,976
Nice.

572
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,676
Think so?

573
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:44,809
Yeah. What is it?

574
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:47,143
Half silk, half cotton,
half linen.

575
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:50,943
How can you go wrong?

576
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,809
[â™ª]

577
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:04,752
My accountant actually did take
a big chunk of money from me,

578
00:22:04,785 --> 00:22:06,285
and use it to buy drugs.

579
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,085
And the thing that was hardest
for me to comprehend about this,

580
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:14,352
is the life choice
of drug abuse and accounting.

581
00:22:14,385 --> 00:22:15,619
But actually, it makes sense.

582
00:22:15,652 --> 00:22:17,619
Why would and athlete
or musician take drugs?

583
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:19,119
They have an interesting job.

584
00:22:19,152 --> 00:22:20,419
But an accountant?

585
00:22:20,452 --> 00:22:22,819
If ever a job required
some hallucinogenic support,

586
00:22:22,852 --> 00:22:24,819
this is the job.

587
00:22:24,852 --> 00:22:26,352
That should be
the legal defense.

588
00:22:26,385 --> 00:22:27,752
You're in court:

589
00:22:27,785 --> 00:22:29,318
"You're charged with possession
of illegal narcotics."

590
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:30,152
"You're charged with possession
of illegal narcotics."

591
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:33,319
"But your honor,
I'm an accountant."

592
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,819
Bang! "Case closed.

593
00:22:34,852 --> 00:22:37,352
"Bailiff, give this man his
peyote buttons and tequila back,

594
00:22:37,385 --> 00:22:38,919
"for the drive home.

595
00:22:38,952 --> 00:22:41,519
Sorry to bother you, sir,
terribly sorry."
