1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:02,202
The basic problem

2
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:04,871
with the beginning
of the relationship, I think,

3
00:00:04,906 --> 00:00:07,374
is that each person
has their own sexual timetable

4
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:08,810
of what should happen when

5
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:11,213
that the other person
knows nothing about.

6
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:12,514
That's why I really think

7
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:14,382
we need some sort
of sexual rule book,

8
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:17,820
where it's written down
and agreed upon,

9
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:19,888
sexual standard
dating procedure.

10
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:21,157
You know what I mean?

11
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,692
So if there's any problems,
you can go,

12
00:00:22,726 --> 00:00:25,429
"Look, honey, I'm very sorry,
but we've been out three times,

13
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:28,032
"and according to Article 7,
Section 5,

14
00:00:28,065 --> 00:00:30,000
"there's got to be
some physical contact,

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,701
"there's got to be
some physical contact,

16
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:32,169
"as you can see, right there.

17
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:34,004
"Otherwise, I will
report you to the board,

18
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:36,474
and they can put out
a warrant for an embrace."

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,382
Wait a second,
wait a second.

20
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:45,051
And then-- And then
the butler says,

21
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:46,452
"I'm not cleaning it up!

22
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:48,521
I'm sick of cleaning!"

23
00:00:48,555 --> 00:00:49,856
That's funny.
That's funny.

24
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:52,392
"I'm sick of cleaning,"
that's very funny.

25
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:54,561
I've never seen a pilot script
as funny as this.

26
00:00:54,594 --> 00:00:55,729
Yeah. It's funny!

27
00:00:55,763 --> 00:00:56,897
I mean, how funny is this?

28
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:57,898
It's funny.

29
00:00:57,931 --> 00:00:59,233
I mean, we're not
stupid, right?

30
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,235
We know when
something's funny.

31
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,470
It cannot not be funny.

32
00:01:02,503 --> 00:01:03,872
Now, come on,
let's stay with it.

33
00:01:03,905 --> 00:01:04,873
We gotta
finish this today.

34
00:01:04,906 --> 00:01:05,974
Okay. Hey, you know,

35
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:07,976
maybe I should give it
to my therapist to read.

36
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,205
She's smart.
I trust her.

37
00:01:08,205 --> 00:01:09,111
She's smart.
I trust her.

38
00:01:09,144 --> 00:01:10,545
Yeah, maybe
I'll give it to Elaine.

39
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,615
Hey, you know,
we haven't brought

40
00:01:12,648 --> 00:01:14,217
the Elaine character
into the show yet.

41
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,219
We should try and get her
into this scene.

42
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:19,289
Right. Right. Okay.

43
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:22,125
"Elaine...enters."

44
00:01:22,158 --> 00:01:24,061
Right.

45
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:26,097
What does she say?

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,635
I don't know.
What do women say?

47
00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:32,137
I don't know.

48
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,638
I don't even know
what they think.

49
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:36,475
That's why
I'm in therapy.

50
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:37,676
If we bring Elaine in,

51
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,205
there's gonna be so many
people to keep track of.

52
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:39,745
there's gonna be so many
people to keep track of.

53
00:01:39,778 --> 00:01:40,914
It's gonna be too hard.

54
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:42,015
I forget where
everybody's standing.

55
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:43,617
You, me, Kramer, the butler.
It's too much.

56
00:01:44,884 --> 00:01:45,952
All right, forget Elaine.

57
00:01:45,985 --> 00:01:46,886
All right.

58
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:49,790
Hey.

Hey.
Hey.

60
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:56,164
You are never gonna believe
who I just ran into today.

61
00:01:56,197 --> 00:01:57,532
Who?
Your old flame,

62
00:01:57,565 --> 00:01:58,633
Gail Cunningham.

63
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,035
Did you talk to her?

64
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:01,970
Well, I was on my way
to the Y,

65
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:03,139
I saw her
coming towards me.

66
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:04,540
I didn't know what to do,

67
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:06,542
because I remember
you had three dates with her

68
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:08,177
and she wouldn't kiss you
good night.

69
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,514
So now I'm thinking, you know,
what is my duty to my friend?

70
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,050
Do I acknowledge her?

71
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,985
Do I ignore her?
What is my responsibility?

72
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:16,353
Well, so, what happened?

73
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,155
Yeah, you know,
she sees me and she goes,

74
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:20,224
[SQUEALING]
"Ooh, hi, Kramer!"

75
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:22,060
You know?
Like nothing happened!

76
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:24,062
Like she never, you know,
went three dates with you,

77
00:02:24,095 --> 00:02:25,730
and refused
to kiss you good night.

78
00:02:25,764 --> 00:02:26,965
I know about
the three dates.

79
00:02:26,998 --> 00:02:28,133
So you know what I did?

80
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:30,202
I snubbed her.

81
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:32,371
What do you mean,
you snubbed her?

82
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:33,706
I walked right
by her, vfft!

83
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:35,341
Never said a word.

84
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,642
Right by her?

85
00:02:36,676 --> 00:02:38,205
Right by her!

86
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:38,511
Right by her!

87
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:40,681
What do you say
about a guy like this?

88
00:02:40,714 --> 00:02:41,882
Huh?
Yeah.

89
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:44,551
You are some great friend,
I'll tell you.

90
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:46,387
Snubbed her.
Not that I condone it.

91
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:50,525
I've never condoned snubbing
in my administration,

92
00:02:50,558 --> 00:02:52,827
but your loyalty
is beyond question.

93
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:54,162
Yeah, well, you know,
she's lucky

94
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:55,330
I was in a good mood.

95
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:56,899
Could've been
a lot worse.

96
00:02:59,402 --> 00:03:01,738
I'm not even in here.

97
00:03:01,771 --> 00:03:02,739
Yeah. I know.

98
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:04,874
Well, I thought
there was gonna be

99
00:03:04,908 --> 00:03:06,343
a character
named Elaine Benes.

100
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:08,205
Well, there were too many
people in the room.

Well, there were too many
people in the room.

We couldn't keep track
of everybody.

George and the the butler...

104

You "couldn't keep track
of everybody"?

00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,554
Well, we tried.
We-- We couldn't.

We didn't know how to...

107
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,391
We couldn't write for a woman.

We didn't know
what you would say.

Even right now,
I'm sitting here,

110
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:25,464
I know you're gonna
say something.

111
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,066
I have no idea what it is.

112

You "have no idea"?

113
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:31,738
Something derogatory?

Ah ha ha. I thought
I'd find you here.

Hey, what is with
your friend Kramer?

Why?
He snubbed me.

Are you sure?

122
00:03:43,618 --> 00:03:45,554
Yeah, I'm sure.
What did you tell him?

123
00:03:45,587 --> 00:03:46,555
Nothing.

00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:47,922
Hey, where are you
going with that?

125
00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:49,759
Gimme that.
Well, I thought you were finished.

126
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,460
I took two bites.
How am I finished?

Plus, you're coming down with something.

00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:58,902
So I want to know,
why did Kramer do that?

131
00:03:58,935 --> 00:04:01,572
Once he leaves the building,
he's out of my jurisdiction.

Well, tell him
that I am mad at him.

00:04:03,774 --> 00:04:05,743
All right.
So where are you cooking now?

What didn't you like about it?

179
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:31,339
It wasn't funny.

180
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,841
"It wasn't funny"?

181
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,242
What, are you kidding?

182
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:36,712
No. I didn't find it funny.

183
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:38,205
You "didn't find it funny"?

184
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:38,714
You "didn't find it funny"?

185
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:41,017
This is what I'm paying for?

186
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,185
Well, that whole
story line

187
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,253
about a guy who
gets into a car accident,

188
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:45,522
doesn't have
any insurance,

189
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:48,225
so the judge sentences him
to be a butler?

190
00:05:48,258 --> 00:05:49,894
I didn't really
buy that.

191
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:52,763
Let me-- Let me tell you
who did, uh, buy it.

192
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:56,801
We pitched this story
to Russell Dalrymple,

193
00:05:56,835 --> 00:05:59,304
the president of NBC,

194
00:05:59,337 --> 00:06:01,072
and he ate it up
with a spoon.

195
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:03,475
George, if you're going to be
in a creative field,

196
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:05,477
you're gonna have to learn
how to deal with criticism.

197
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:07,480
How's this for criticism?

198
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:08,205
Um...

199
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:08,915
Um...

200
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:11,919
You stink.
How do you like that criticism?

201
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:13,754
You know what's funny to me?

202
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:15,889
That diploma up on the wall.

203
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:18,759
That is my idea of co-me-dy:

204
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:21,162
you sitting here,
telling people what to do.

205
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:22,496
I think you better go.

206
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,599
Oh, I'm going, baby.
I'm going.

207
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,769
It's Jerry's fault.

208
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:30,840
He took out all my good lines.

209
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:32,775
He's such a control freak!

210
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:38,205
So you send me
to this therapist

211
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:38,682
So you send me
to this therapist

my emotional disorders,

our script.

a therapist is that?

215
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:48,159
Well, I guess she didn't think
it was funny.

216
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:49,827
Oh, "she didn't think
it was funny"?

meet with NBC tomorrow.

my confidence.

00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:59,172
I'm paying for this.
She's my employee.

221
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:00,773
I thought your mother's
paying for it.

222
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:04,043
And she slaves
to earn every penny,

223

so that some day I might be able
to walk up to a woman,

224
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:08,205
and say, "Yes, I'm bald,
but I'm still a good person."

225
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:11,351
and say, "Yes, I'm bald,
but I'm still a good person."

226

You know, he's right.

227
00:07:12,553 --> 00:07:14,122
It's not her place
to criticize the script,

228
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:16,124
which reminds me,
what did you think of it?

229
00:07:16,157 --> 00:07:17,192
You never told me.

Yeah, I kissed her.

00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:37,515
You kissed her?

240
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:38,205
Right on the mouth.

What kind of great friend
are you?

00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:43,221
How do you go from snubbing
to kissing?

244
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,424
Well, you know, I saw her
outside the Y, you know.

245
00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:47,526
She came up to me,
she started yelling, you know,

246
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,594
because I snubbed her.
And, uh, then, uh, you know,

247
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:50,930
we started talking a little bit,

248
00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:52,865
and I-- I walked her
to her building,

249
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:54,400
and just before I left,

250
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:56,436
I put my arm around her waist,

251
00:07:56,469 --> 00:08:00,574
I pulled her to me,
and I-- I planted one.

252

did she do?

253
00:08:03,377 --> 00:08:04,378
She kissed me back.

she doesn't want
to shake my hand,

00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:10,618
why is she kissing you?
Well...

259
00:08:11,386 --> 00:08:12,754
Because I snubbed her.
