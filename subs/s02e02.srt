00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:37,272
Oh, uh, I don't
really eat dessert.

177
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:38,939
I'm dieting.

178
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:40,172
Yeah, I can't
eat dessert either.

179
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:42,172
The sugar makes
my ankles swell up

180
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:43,172
and I can't dance.

181
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:44,839
Can't dance?

He's kidding, Manya.

MANYA:
Is that a joke?

184
00:06:49,872 --> 00:06:52,006
So did you hear
Claire's getting married?

185
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,345
Yeah, yeah.

186
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:53,439
Yeah, yeah.

187

I hear the fellow
owns a couple race horses.

188
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:57,172
You know, trotters,
like at Yonkers.

189

JERRY: Horses.

190
00:06:58,206 --> 00:07:00,839
They're like big riding dogs.

191
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:02,472
ELAINE:
What about ponies, huh?

192
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,906
What kind of
abnormal animal is that?

193
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:08,006
And those kids
who had their own ponies...

194
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,672
I know, I hated those kids.

195
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:11,339
In fact, I hate anyone

196
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:13,339
that ever had a pony
when they were growing up.

197
00:07:13,372 --> 00:07:15,039
I had a pony.

198
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:23,345
Well, I didn't,
uh, really mean a pony per se.

199
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:24,839
Well, I didn't,
uh, really mean a pony per se.

200
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:28,472
When I was
a little girl in Poland,

201
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:30,806
we all had ponies.

202
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:34,172
My sister had pony.
My cousin had pony.

203
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:35,739
So, what's wrong with that?

204
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:37,639
Nothing. Nothing at all.

205
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:38,839
I was just merely expressing--

206
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:40,339
Should we have
some coffee?

207
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:42,772
Who's having coffee?

208
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:44,839
He was a beautiful pony.

209
00:07:44,872 --> 00:07:46,506
And I loved him.

210
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:48,172
Well, I'm sure you did.

211
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:49,572
Who wouldn't love a pony?

212
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:52,406
Who wouldn't love a person
that had a pony?

213
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,345
You.

214
00:07:53,345 --> 00:07:53,639
You.

215
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:54,839
You said so.

216
00:07:54,872 --> 00:07:57,606
No, see, we didn't have ponies.

217
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,806
I'm sure at that time in Poland,
they were very common.

218
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,106
They were probably
like compact cars.

219
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:05,739
That's it!

220
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:07,839
I had enough!

221
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:13,106
Have your coffee,
everybody.

222
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,506
She's a little upset.

223
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:17,172
It's been an emotional day.

224
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:23,272
I didn't know
she had a pony.

225
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:23,345
How was I to know
she had a pony?

226
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:26,306
How was I to know
she had a pony?

227
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,372
Who figures an immigrant's
gonna have a pony?

228
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:34,106
Do you know
what the odds are on that?

229
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,672
I mean,
in all the pictures I saw

230
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:38,806
of immigrants on boats
coming into New York harbor,

231
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,039
I never saw one of them
sitting on a pony.

232
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:46,906
Why would anyone come here
if they had a pony?

233
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:48,506
Who leaves a country
packed with ponies

234
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:50,206
to come to
a non-pony country?

235
00:08:51,972 --> 00:08:53,345
It doesn't make sense.

236
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:54,639
It doesn't make sense.

237
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:57,206
Am I wrong?

238
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,172
I'll drive you
to the airport.

239
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:04,672
No, we're taking a cab.

240
00:09:04,706 --> 00:09:06,672
I just hope
that the whole pony incident

241
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:09,506
didn't put a damper
on the trip.

242
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:12,139
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
It was a misunderstanding.

Nobody likes
a kid with a pony.

Well, if you ever talk to her,
tell her I'm sorry.

246
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:21,172
Elaine too.
She feels terrible.

247
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:23,139
You know, you should
give Manya a call.

248
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:23,345
Maybe I will.

00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:24,839

Oh, it's nothing.

coming along?

I'm not going to do it.

What a shock.

Yes, I know
you're not gonna do it,

00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,106
that's why I bet.

There's no bet
if I'm not doing it.

That's the bet,
that you're not doing it.

00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:10,172
Yeah, well, I could do it,
I don't want to do it.

We didn't bet on
if you wanted to do it,

What's wrong with it?

355
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:51,968
It looks ridiculous.

356
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:53,968
What, I'm going to buy
a new sport jacket now?

357
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:55,368
I don't know
what to do.

358
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:58,501
You know what this funeral
is going to wind up costing me?

359
00:12:58,535 --> 00:12:59,868
Oh, boy.

360
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:02,537
We don't understand death,

361
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:04,335
We don't understand death,

362
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,401
and the proof of this

363
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:08,701
is that we give dead people
a pillow.

364
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,901
And, I mean, hey, you know,

365
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:13,801
I think
if you can't stretch out

366
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:17,368
and get
some solid rest at that point,

367
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:19,968
I don't see
how bedding accessories

368
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:22,868
really make the difference.

369
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:25,735
I mean, they got the guy
in a suit with a pillow.

370
00:13:25,768 --> 00:13:27,468
Now, is he going to a meeting,

371
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:29,468
or is he catching 40 winks?

372
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,868
I mean, let's make up our mind
where we think they're going.

373
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:35,635
I actually like ponies.

374
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:38,668
I was just trying
to make conversation.

375
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:40,701
What time is your game?

376
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,735
2:45.

377
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:45,068
And what time
is the funeral?

378
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:46,701
Two o'clock.

379
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:48,068
How long does
a funeral take?

380
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:51,668
Depends on how nice
the person was,

381
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:56,901
but you got to figure
even Oswald took 45 minutes.

382
00:13:56,935 --> 00:13:58,901
So you can't do both.

383
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:01,468
You know, if the situation
were reversed

384
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:02,537
and Manya had some
mahjong championship,

385
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:03,568
and Manya had some
mahjong championship,

386
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,568
or something,

387
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:07,568
I wouldn't expect her
to go to my funeral.

388
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:09,901
I would understand.

389
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:12,135
How can you even
consider not going?

390
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:15,001
You know, I've been thinking.

391
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:16,835
I cannot envision
any circumstance

392
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:18,068
in which I'll ever have

393
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:20,035
the opportunity
to have sex again.

394
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:25,601
How's it going to happen?

395
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,635
I just don't see
how it could occur.

396
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,537
You know, funerals
always make me think

397
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:33,068
You know, funerals
always make me think

398
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:34,301
about my own mortality

399
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:37,335
and how I'm actually
going to die some day.

400
00:14:37,368 --> 00:14:39,401
Me, dead.

401
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:40,835
Huh, imagine that.

402
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:43,468
They always make me
take stock of my life

403
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:45,468
and how I've pretty much
wasted all of it.

404
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,635
and how I plan
to continue wasting it.

405
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:49,901
I know, and then
you say to yourself,

406
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:53,235
"From this moment on,
I'm not wasting any more of it."

407
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,835
But then you go, "How?

408
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:56,901
I mean, what can I do
that's not wasting it?"

409
00:14:56,935 --> 00:14:58,301
Well, is this
a waste of time?

410
00:14:58,335 --> 00:14:59,735
What should we be doing?

411
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:01,701
Can't you have
coffee with people?

412
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:02,537
You know, I can't believe

413
00:15:02,537 --> 00:15:03,568
You know, I can't believe

414
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:05,635
you're even considering
not playing.

415
00:15:05,668 --> 00:15:07,635
We need you.
You're hitting everything.

416
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:09,001
He has to go.

417
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:11,035
He may have killed her.

418
00:15:12,935 --> 00:15:14,568
Me? What about you?

419
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:16,235
You brought up the pony.

420
00:15:16,268 --> 00:15:18,401
Oh, yeah,

421
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:22,201
but I didn't say
I hated anyone who had one.

422
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:23,568
Who's going to play left field?

423
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:25,568
Bender?

424
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:27,968
Bender? He can't play left.

425
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:29,535
He stinks.

426
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:32,537
I just don't see what purpose
it's going to serve, you going.

427
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:32,835
I just don't see what purpose
it's going to serve, you going.

428
00:15:32,868 --> 00:15:36,335
I mean, you think dead people
care who's at their funeral?

429
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,401
They don't even know
they're having a funeral.

430
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:40,401
It's not like she's hanging out
in the back going,

431
00:15:40,435 --> 00:15:42,701
"I can't believe
Jerry didn't show up."

432
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:45,801
Maybe she's there in spirit.
How about that?

433
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:48,068
If you're a spirit,

434
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:50,635
and you can travel to other
dimensions and galaxies,

435
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:53,201
and find out
the mysteries of the universe,

436
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:54,801
you think she's gonna want
to hang out

437
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:56,235
at Drexler's funeral home
on Ocean Parkway?

438
00:15:56,268 --> 00:15:59,135
George, I met this woman.

439
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:01,501
She is not traveling
to any other dimensions.

440
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,537
Do you know how easy it is
for dead people to travel?

441
00:16:02,537 --> 00:16:06,068
Do you know how easy it is
for dead people to travel?

442
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:07,735
It's not like getting on a bus.

443
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:10,201
One second.
It's all mental.

444
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:16,801
50 years
they were married.

445
00:16:16,835 --> 00:16:17,801
Now he's moving
to Phoenix.

446
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:20,368
Phoenix?

447
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:22,468
What's happening
with his apartment?

448
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:23,668
I don't know.

449
00:16:23,701 --> 00:16:25,735
They've been in there
since, like, World War II.

450
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:27,535
Rent's $300 a month.

451
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:30,668
Three hundred a month?

452
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:32,537
Oh, my God.

453
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:33,068

Although this may seem like a sad event,

455
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:39,801
it should not be
a day of mourning,

456
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:44,035
for Manya had
a rich, fulfilling life.

457
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:47,201
She grew up
in a different world,

458
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:48,801
a simpler world,

459
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:52,735
with loving parents,
a beautiful home in the country,

460
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:55,501
and, from what I understand,
she even had a pony.

461
00:16:58,068 --> 00:17:01,068
Oh, how she loved
that pony.

It was the pride
of Crakow.

Well, the game's starting
just about now.

00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:28,868
It was good that
the two of you came.

471
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:30,001

You got your degree.

They just want
to see something.

478
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:44,235
I just wanted to say
how sorry I was.

479
00:17:44,268 --> 00:17:48,068
Jerry, you want
to hear something?

480
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,868
Your cousin Jeffrey
is switching parks.

481
00:17:50,901 --> 00:17:53,001
They're transferring him
to Riverside,

482
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:55,068
so he'll completely revamp
that operation.

00:17:56,268 --> 00:17:57,568
Yeah.

485
00:17:57,601 --> 00:18:02,168
He'll do in Riverside now
what he did in Central Park.

486
00:18:02,201 --> 00:18:02,537
More money.

487
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:03,801
More money.

488
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:07,901
So...that's your cousin.

I've never paid full fare.

491
00:18:12,035 --> 00:18:13,568
Once again,
I just wanted to say

492
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:16,335
how sorry I am
about the other night.

00:18:16,368 --> 00:18:17,401
Oh, me too.

494
00:18:17,435 --> 00:18:19,668
No, no, no.
She forgot all about that.

495
00:18:21,035 --> 00:18:24,301
She was much more upset
about the potato salad.

496
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:28,135
So I understand
you're moving to Phoenix.

497
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:29,301
Yeah.

498
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:30,401
My brother lives there.

00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:32,537
I think Manya
would have liked Phoenix.

Mm. Gorgeous,

00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:40,335
So, what's happening
with your apartment?

503
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:43,535
Of course,
it's very hot there.

504
00:18:43,568 --> 00:18:45,068
I'll have to get
an air conditioner.

505
00:18:45,101 --> 00:18:46,301
Oh, you can have mine.

00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:47,901

that big apartment
on West End Avenue?

00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:55,068
Although they say
it's a dry heat.

510
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,368
Dry, wet.

What's happening
with your apartment?

I don't even know

513
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:02,537
if I should take
my winter clothing.

514
00:19:02,537 --> 00:19:03,901
if I should take
my winter clothing.

515
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:07,901
I have an idea.

516
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:11,201
Leave the winter clothing
in the apartment,

517
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:13,301
and I'll watch it for you,

518
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:14,701
and I'll live there,

519
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:17,868
and I'll make sure
that nothing happens to it.

520
00:19:17,901 --> 00:19:20,901
Oh, the apartment.

521
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:22,635
Jeffrey's taking the apartment.

522
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:25,235
Oh, Jeffrey.

00:19:25,268 --> 00:19:27,735

529
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:38,235
JERRY:
It's raining?

530
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:41,735
It's raining.

531
00:19:41,768 --> 00:19:43,735
The game will be postponed.

532
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:45,468
We'll play tomorrow.

533
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:48,035
Believe me,
I wouldn't bother you

534
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:52,235
if the Army hadn't closed
that base in Sarasota.

535
00:19:52,268 --> 00:19:54,635
Here, scribble
a little something here.

536
00:19:54,668 --> 00:19:56,501
I can't.
I'll get in trouble.

537
00:19:56,535 --> 00:19:58,268
Oh, for God's sake.

538
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:02,537
Who gets picked off in softball?

539
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:02,601
Who gets picked off in softball?

540
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:05,835
It's unheard of.

541
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:06,835
Never happened to me before.

542
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:09,635
I remember saying
to myself,

543
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:13,135
"Why is Jerry
so far off the base?"

544
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:15,068
I'll have to live
with this shame

545
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:16,668
for the rest of my life.

546
00:20:16,701 --> 00:20:18,068
Then in the fifth inning,

547
00:20:18,101 --> 00:20:19,968
why did you take off
on the pop fly?

548
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:21,901
I thought
there were two outs.

549
00:20:21,935 --> 00:20:25,301
I couldn't believe it
when I saw you running.

550
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:28,368
I thought maybe they had
changed the rules or something.

551
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:32,168
It was the single
worst moment of my life.

552
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:32,537
What about Sharon Besser?

553
00:20:32,537 --> 00:20:33,901
What about Sharon Besser?

554
00:20:33,935 --> 00:20:36,468
Oh, well, of course, 1973.

555
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,068
Makes you wonder,
though, doesn't it?

556
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:40,068
Wonder about what?

557
00:20:41,835 --> 00:20:43,068
You know.

558
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:44,068
The spirit world.

559
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:47,635
What, you think Manya
showed up during the game

560
00:20:47,668 --> 00:20:48,835
and put a hex on me?

561
00:20:48,868 --> 00:20:52,335
I never saw anyone
play like that.

562
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:54,368
But I went to the funeral.

563
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:59,635
Yeah, but that doesn't
make up for killing her.

564
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:00,968
Maybe Manya
missed the funeral

565
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:02,537
because she was off visiting
another galaxy that day.

566
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:03,868
because she was off visiting
another galaxy that day.

567
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:06,901
Don't you think she would
have heard I was there?

568
00:21:06,935 --> 00:21:10,035
Not necessarily.

569
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:16,035
Who figures an immigrant's
going to have a pony?

570
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:19,401
What is the pony?

571
00:21:19,435 --> 00:21:20,801
What is the point of the pony?

572
00:21:20,835 --> 00:21:23,668
Why do we have these animals,
these ponies?

573
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:26,901
What do we do with them,
besides the pony ride?

574
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:29,401
Why ponies?
What are we doing with them?

575
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:32,068
I mean, police don't use them
for, you know, crowd control.

576
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:32,537
"Hey, uh, you want to get back
behind the barricades?

577
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:36,335
"Hey, uh, you want to get back
behind the barricades?

578
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:37,635
"Hey.

579
00:21:37,668 --> 00:21:39,635
"Hey, little boy.

580
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:41,401
"Yeah, I'm talking to you.

581
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:45,035
Just... Behind the barricades."

582
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:50,068
So somebody, I assume,

583
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,368
genetically engineered
these ponies.

584
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:54,168
Do you think they could
make them any size?

585
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:56,535
Could they make them,
like, the size of a quarter

586
00:21:56,568 --> 00:21:57,901
if they wanted?

587
00:21:57,935 --> 00:22:00,035
That would be fun for Monopoly,
though, wouldn't it?

588
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,301
Just have a little pony,
and you put him on the...

589
00:22:02,335 --> 00:22:02,537
"Baltic.
That's two down, go ahead.

590
00:22:02,537 --> 00:22:04,568
"Baltic.
That's two down, go ahead.

591
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:06,135
"Hold it.
Right there, Baltic.

592
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:08,935
Yeah, fine. Right there.
Hold it right there."
