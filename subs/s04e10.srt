1
00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:03,800
There's no easy way
to break off any relationship.

2
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:05,200
I think
when you first start dating,

3
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:06,366
they ought to give you

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,033
three "Get out of relationship
free" cards.

5
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:09,166
You know what I mean?

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,366
So you can just
go up to the person and go,

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,233
"Uh, here you go. I'm sorry.
I'll grab the tennis racket.

8
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:17,633
Don't even bother to get up.
Have a good one. Sorry."

9
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,066
Which is fine,
unless, of course,

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,633
the person you're
in the relationship with

11
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,066
happens to have

12
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,300
an "Eight more months of guilt,
torture, and pain" card.

13
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,266
"Uh, hold it. I've got
a little something for you."

14
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:33,566
We're dead.

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,400
We're not dead.
We are dead.

16
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:36,833
Come on, we got
all day tomorrow

17
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:38,033
to come up
with a story.

18
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:39,233
All day tomorrow?

19
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:41,633
We had a month and a half
to come up with something.

20
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,633
We didn't do anything!

21
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,733
So we'll do it
tomorrow.

22
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:46,000
Let me ask you this,

23
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:47,400
when's the last time
you went skiing?

24
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:49,066
About six years ago.

25
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,866
I think you can take
the lift ticket

26
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,900
off your jacket now.

27
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:56,033
Women like skiers.

28
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:57,366
So what?
You can't meet anybody.

29
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
You're going out
with Susan.

30
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:58,737
Yeah. Right.

31
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:00,833
Yeah. Right.

32
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,033
Hey, see those two women
over there?

33
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,666
I almost dated
the one on the right.

34
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,733
She's in
the closet business.

35
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,366
The closet business?

36
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,466
What's the closet business?

37
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,233
What is it
your business?

38
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:13,900
I'm interested.

39
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:16,500
She reorganizes
your closet

40
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:19,533
and shows you how
to maximize your closet space.

41
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:20,700
She looked
into my closet.

42
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:21,966
So you thought
she was good-looking

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,166
and figured this would be
a good way to meet her.

44
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,166
Yeah.

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,166
Yeah.

46
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,166
So what happened?

47
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,533
So she mentioned
she had a boyfriend,

48
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:28,737
and then it hit me--

49
00:01:28,737 --> 00:01:29,633
and then it hit me--

50
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,566
What do I need
more closet space for?

51
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,066
Hi, Marla.

52
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,966
Jerry!

53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
George, Marla.

54
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:38,000
Marla.

55
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:39,200
George, Jerry, Stacy.

56
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,566
Stacy.
Jerry.

57
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,566
George, Stacy.
Stacy.

58
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,566
George.

59
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,000
George.

60
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:47,733
Jerry.

61
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:49,000
Marla.

62
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:50,000
Stacy!

63
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,866
So how was your
trip to Berlin?

64
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,200
Trip to Berlin?

65
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:58,737
Remember? That's why you put off
doing the closets.

66
00:01:58,737 --> 00:01:59,133
Remember? That's why you put off
doing the closets.

67
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,166
You said you were going
to Berlin for a while.

68
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,666
Oh, right. Right.

69
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,733
The wall had just come
down, and you told me

70
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:07,900
you wanted to be part
of the celebration.

71
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:09,166
Yes. Yes, I did.

72
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,166
But you know,
I was watching it on CNN,

73
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,533
and they covered it so well,

74
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,733
I thought,
"Why knock my brains out?"

75
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:17,500
You know,
my boyfriend went.

76
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:18,500
Really?

77
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:20,200
Yes, I told him
all about you going,

78
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:22,300
and he got all excited
and decided to go.

79
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,466
Oh, did he like it?

80
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,166
I don't know.
He never came back.

81
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,866
Anyway, we met with NBC
about a month ago,

82
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,737
and they gave us
the green light

83
00:02:28,737 --> 00:02:29,733
and they gave us
the green light

84
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:31,133
to go ahead
and write a pilot.

85
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,333
In fact, we've got a big
meeting with them tomorrow.

86
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:34,533
They gotta approve
of the story

87
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:35,633
before we can write it.

88
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:39,800
Wow. What a great job,
a writer!

89
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:40,800
Oh.

90
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:44,033
Not a bad way
to earn a buck.

91
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:45,466
Sounds great.

92
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,666
Well, I tell
you, Stacy,

93
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,400
it's a lot
of hard work,

94
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:53,466
but it comes
fairly easy to me.

95
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,633
Some people
write symphonies.

96
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:56,666
This is my gift.

97
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,700
So you gonna
go out with her?

98
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,666
I might.

99
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,800
What about Susan?

100
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,400
What? I'm not married.

101
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:10,233
I'm not allowed to go out
with somebody else?

102
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:11,233
Depends.

103
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:12,400
Depends on what?

104
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:13,466
On many factors.

105
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,466
Like what?

106
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,466
Well...

107
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,066
How long you
been seeing her.

108
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,833
What's your
phone call frequency?

109
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,466
Are you on a daily?

110
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,733
Nah, semi-daily.
Four, five times a week.

111
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:24,900
What about
Saturday nights?

112
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:27,066
You have to ask her out,
or is a date implied?

113
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,300
It's implied.

114
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:28,737
She got anything
in your medicine cabinet?

115
00:03:28,737 --> 00:03:30,666
She got anything
in your medicine cabinet?

116
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,166
Might be
some moisturizer.

117
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,733
Uh-huh.

118
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:37,300
Let me ask you this.

119
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,200
Is there any Tampax
in your house?

120
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,300
Yeah.

121
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,033
Well, I'll tell you
what you got here.

122
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,033
Yeah?

123
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:51,066
You got yourself
a girlfriend.

124
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,700
Oh, no, no.

125
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,833
What, are you sure?
A girlfriend?

126
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:56,566
I'm looking at a guy
on a semi-daily

127
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,700
with Tampax
in his house

128
00:03:57,733 --> 00:03:58,737
and an implied date
on Saturday night.

129
00:03:58,737 --> 00:03:59,666
and an implied date
on Saturday night.

130
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,333
I would like
to help you out, but--

131
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,333
Do you believe my luck?

132
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:05,533
The first time in my life
I have a good answer

133
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:07,066
to the question
"What do you do?"

134
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,166
and I have a girlfriend.

135
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,633
I mean, you don't need
a girlfriend

136
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,000
when you can answer
that question.

137
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:13,000
That's what you say
in order to get girlfriends.

138
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:15,000
Once you can get girlfriends,
you don't want a girlfriend,

139
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:17,500
you just want
more girlfriends.

140
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:20,800
You're gonna make
a very good father someday.

141
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,700
Well, it's not fair, Jerry.
It's just not fair.

142
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,666
That's it.
I'm getting out of this thing.

143
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,866
Fine, break up with her,

144
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,466
but you know what
this means, don't you?

145
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:28,737
No. What?

146
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:29,666
No. What?

147
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,400
The script, the pilot,
the TV show, all over.

148
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:33,200
Why? What do you mean?

149
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,200
Figure it out. She's one
of the executives at NBC

150
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,300
that's gonna
make the decision

151
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,866
whether or not
they pick up the show.

152
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,066
She's one of our
biggest fans.

153
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,733
You drop her off,

154
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:42,166
you think they're
gonna pick us up?

155
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,533
Oh, right.

156
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:45,533
Oh, no. Man...

157
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:48,500
You know, it's a very
interesting situation.

158
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:51,233
Here, you have a job
that could help you get girls,

159
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:53,366
but you also have
a relationship,

160
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,466
but if you try and get rid
of the relationship

161
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,666
so you can get the girls,

162
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,666
you lose the job.

163
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:58,737
You see the irony?

164
00:04:58,737 --> 00:04:59,800
You see the irony?

165
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,100
Yeah, yeah, I see the irony.

166
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,166
All right, what--
what about this?

167
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,533
What if I could find some way
to break up with her

168
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:08,866
so that she'll
still like me

169
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,333
and it doesn't affect
the deal?

170
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:11,333
Oh, yeah.

171
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:13,133
Wait, wait, wait.
Hear me out. Hear me out.

172
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,366
Don't dismiss this.

173
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,133
You're very quick to dismiss.
Don't dismiss.

174
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,300
She's got a big crush
on David Letterman.

175
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,400
I mean, a big crush.

176
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:22,800
She talks about him
all the time.

177
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:26,200
Suppose I go up
to David Letterman.

178
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:27,800
He works at NBC.

179
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:28,737

Well, I don't want
a big, flat noodle.

What kind of noodle
do you want?

357
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:21,666
Who says
I want a noodle?

All right, look,
I'm getting the Chow Fun.

You don't have
to have any.

00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,566
I'll get the pea pods,

361

any of my pea pods.

Fine.

Look, Marla,

366
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:39,733
this whole sex thing
is totally overrated.

367
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,466
Now, the one thing
you've gotta be ready for

368
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,666
is how the man changes into

to their personality.

It's really quite astounding.

372
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,833
It's like, uh,
they committed a crime,

373
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:57,200
and they want to flee the scene
before the police get there.

374
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,066
So they just leave?

375
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,800
Yeah, pretty much. Yeah.

376
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,033
Well, the smart ones start
working on their getaway stories

How, you know, they gotta
get up early tomorrow.

It's always about
being up early.

into farmers suddenly.

Wow. You must be really good
to put up with all that.

Don't worry,
he'll be here.

387

We only got
about two hours.

388
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,737
We just need
one good story idea,

We just need
one good story idea,

390
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:30,466

Hey, what about this?

394
00:12:36,066 --> 00:12:38,133
I'm in a car accident.

395

The motorist is uninsured.
You with me?

396

Yeah.

397

My car's totaled.

398
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,033
It's all his fault.

399
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,666
Now, he has absolutely no money.

400
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,000
There is no way
that he could pay me.

Marla and I
went out for coffee,

I was crossing the street,

right towards me.

to sit in for him.

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,504
Well, I think we should
get started anyway.

508
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:14,770
Yeah. Good idea.

509
00:16:14,804 --> 00:16:14,937

coming along?

So how are you guys
coming along?

00:16:16,304 --> 00:16:19,537
Good, good.
We've got a number of ideas.

512
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,004
Good.

513
00:16:23,904 --> 00:16:25,470
Have you ever been
to a Chinese restaurant,

514
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:27,870
and they tell you it'll be,
like, five minutes for a table,

515
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,004
and you wind waiting there
for, like, 30 minutes?

516
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:34,204
Well, we thought
it would be very funny

517
00:16:34,237 --> 00:16:36,504
to do an entire show

518
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,470
where all you're doing
is waiting for the table.

519
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:44,337
Because we've all been
in that situation.

520
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,704
You know, you're...
you're waiting,

521
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:50,104
and you're hungry,

522
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:52,570
and you bump into
somebody you know.

When is Russell coming back?

524
00:16:59,037 --> 00:17:00,170
So that's the idea?

525
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:03,370
Well, no. That's one.

526
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:04,637
We have many others.

530
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,537
I get into an accident
with a guy who has no insurance,

531
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,670

to be my butler.

538
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,704
and I'm walking around

539
00:17:27,737 --> 00:17:29,504
wearing one of those big
neck collars, you know.

540
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:32,804
Those collars
are funny!

541

in one of those collars,

immediately.

544
00:17:39,504 --> 00:17:41,870
Is that beautiful,

556
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:00,870
I thought
I was getting the butler.

Don't worry, we'll find
something for you.

No, he said there was nothing
he could do, and that next time,

was in bad shape.

What else did you
say to her?

00:20:50,304 --> 00:20:53,004
Nothing. I was just
giving her the straight dope.

636
