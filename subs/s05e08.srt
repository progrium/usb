1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,600
The old-fashioned barbershop is,
unfortunately,

2
00:00:03,633 --> 00:00:05,266
becoming a thing of the past.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,266
Now, what went wrong?

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,266
Well, first of all,

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,633
he needs a $20,000 chair

6
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,966
to make a $3 tip.

7
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:14,895
I say cut back on the chair,

8
00:00:14,928 --> 00:00:17,428
update the magazines.

9
00:00:17,462 --> 00:00:20,228
Why do barbers
always display that license?

10
00:00:20,262 --> 00:00:21,928
There's no laws in hair cutting.

11
00:00:21,962 --> 00:00:23,695
But show customers
the back of their head.

12
00:00:23,728 --> 00:00:24,895
That's the one law.

13
00:00:24,928 --> 00:00:26,462
I don't want to see the back
of my head.

14
00:00:26,495 --> 00:00:27,695
Why do I want to see something

15
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,128
that I won't see
at any other time?

16
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,000
When I buy pants,

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,528
When I buy pants,

18
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:32,628
two salesmen don't lift me up
by the legs and go:

19
00:00:32,662 --> 00:00:35,128
"How do you like the crotch?"

20
00:00:35,162 --> 00:00:37,595
If I wanted to see everything,
I would've been a fly.

21
00:00:40,495 --> 00:00:43,728
[â™ª]

22
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:46,395
Well, George, we here at Sanalac
like to think of ourselves

23
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:48,028
as a fairly
progressive company.

24
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:50,562
We have a small, but
prestigious, group of clients.

25
00:00:50,595 --> 00:00:52,728
Well, a lot of people
consider me, uh,

26
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,328
small and prestigious.

27
00:00:55,762 --> 00:00:57,595
That's funny,
George.

28
00:00:57,628 --> 00:00:58,595
You're very quick.

29
00:00:58,628 --> 00:00:59,595
Ah, well.

30
00:00:59,628 --> 00:01:01,462
I feel like I don't--

31
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:04,262
I don't have to explain
every little thing to you.

32
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:06,062
You understand
everything immediately.

33
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:08,956
I enjoy
understanding.

34
00:01:08,956 --> 00:01:09,062
I enjoy
understanding.

35
00:01:10,062 --> 00:01:11,695
I want you
to have this job.

36
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:12,695
Of course--

37
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:13,695
Stu Zimmer
line two.

38
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,928
Great.
Thanks.

39
00:01:15,962 --> 00:01:17,095
I've gotta
take this call.

40
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:18,428
Listen.

41
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:20,662
I'm really glad
that you came in.

42
00:01:22,728 --> 00:01:25,028
"I want you
to have this job.

43
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:27,862
Of course..."

44
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:29,028
Wha... Yeah?

45
00:01:29,062 --> 00:01:30,528
That's it.

46
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:32,295
What? What do you mean,
"That's it?"

47
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:33,695
He never finished
his sentence.

48
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:35,428
He got a call,
ended the interview.

49
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,928
"Of course,"
was the last thing?

50
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:38,262
Maybe he was going to say,

51
00:01:38,295 --> 00:01:38,956
"Of course, I have to check
with my associates."

52
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:41,062
"Of course, I have to check
with my associates."

53
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:43,262
"I want you to have this job,
of course...

54
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:45,128
"the Board of Directors
is under indictment

55
00:01:45,162 --> 00:01:46,728
and will be serving time."

56
00:01:46,762 --> 00:01:48,462
"I want you to have this job,
of course...

57
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:49,962
sodomy is
a prerequisite."

58
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:51,962
Oh, all right.

59
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:54,028
Why don't you just
go ahead and call him?

60
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:55,462
Because he made a big deal

61
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,595
about how I understand
everything immediately.

62
00:01:57,628 --> 00:01:58,895
That's what impressed him.

63
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:00,895
So if you call to ask
if you have the job,

64
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:02,095
you might lose the job.

65
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:03,128
And if I don't call--

66
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:04,262
You might have
the job,

67
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:05,362
but you'll never
know it.

68
00:02:05,395 --> 00:02:06,362
Oh.

69
00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:07,562
What kind
of company is it?

70
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:08,762
Rest stop supply.

71
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:08,956
Oh. Oh.

72
00:02:08,956 --> 00:02:09,795
Oh. Oh.

73
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:11,628
Good for you.

74
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:13,228
Hey. Yup, yup, yup.

75
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:14,928
Hey.

76
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:15,962
Shower?

77
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:16,962
Haircut.

78
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:18,062
I'm very happy
with this.

79
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:19,095
Who'd you use,
Gino?

80
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:20,295
Of course.

81
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:21,962
Wouldn't let that
butcher cut my hair.

82
00:02:21,995 --> 00:02:23,395
What butcher?

83
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:25,395
The uncle: Enzo.
Jerry uses him.

84
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:27,195
I've been going to him
for 12 years.

85
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:29,095
I can't switch.
I'd hurt his feelings.

86
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:30,728
You never get
good haircuts.

87
00:02:30,762 --> 00:02:32,095
You can get
a good one today.

88
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:35,195
It's Enzo's day off.
Gino's there all by himself.

89
00:02:35,228 --> 00:02:36,595
Really?

90
00:02:36,628 --> 00:02:38,956
Yeah, you know what? You should
get one for my bachelor auction.

91
00:02:38,956 --> 00:02:39,762
Yeah, you know what? You should
get one for my bachelor auction.

92
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:41,262
What bachelor
auction?

93
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,095
Oh, it's this thing
where they auction off

94
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:44,962
dates with bachelors
for charity.

95
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:46,762
And you didn't
ask me to do it?

96
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:49,295
I could raise enough
money to cure polio.

97
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:52,028
I believe they've had a cure
for polio for quite some time.

98
00:02:52,062 --> 00:02:53,828
Polio?

99
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:56,595
Will you go ahead?

100
00:02:56,628 --> 00:02:58,428
You need a haircut.

101
00:02:58,462 --> 00:03:00,162
Okay.

102
00:03:01,262 --> 00:03:02,628
What are you
all dressed up for?

103
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:03,728
Had a job
interview.

104
00:03:03,762 --> 00:03:04,862
Yeah? How'd it go?

105
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:05,895
Good.

106
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:07,828
Of course...

107
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:15,895
[ITALIAN ACCENT]
Ah, Jerry!

108
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:17,295
Oh. Hi, Enzo.

109
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:19,228
You come
for the haircut.

110
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:20,395
Uh, no.
Actually, I was--

111
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:21,395
It's my day off,

112
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:23,228
but I take care
of you anyway,

113
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:25,862
because you my favorite
customer. You been with me

114
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:27,295
for so long.

115
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:28,895
You're so loyal.

116
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:31,895
Well, uh,
if it's your day off--

117
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:33,395
Eh, what's
the difference?

118
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:34,462
It takes
ten minutes.

119
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:35,828
Well, it's...

120
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:38,956
Jerry, today I'm going to do
something special for you.

121
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:42,095
Jerry, today I'm going to do
something special for you.

122
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:43,562
I don't wanna take
too much off.

123
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:45,762
Hey, who's
your barber, eh?

124
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:47,195
You tell the joke,

125
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,095
I cut the hair.

126
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,462
Gino, you've outdone
yourself this time.

127
00:03:52,495 --> 00:03:55,395
This is the best haircut
I've ever had.

128
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:08,956
He massacred you!

129
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:10,295
He massacred you!

130
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:11,695
I know.

131
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:13,762
You look like
you're five years-old.

132
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:18,462
What if I shampoo?
Sometimes a shampoo helps.

133
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:20,562
You gotta start
seeing somebody else.

134
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:22,695
Get out
of this relationship.

135
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:24,562
I can't.
He loves me.

136
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:26,195
He says I'm his
most loyal customer.

137
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:27,762
Plus, he's right there
on the corner.

138
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:29,895
I'd have to pass him
every day when I go by.

139
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:31,195
But,
you gotta do it.

140
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:33,662
I can't, I can't.
I'd break his heart.

141
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:36,628
Ah.

142
00:04:36,662 --> 00:04:38,956
No way
my Gino did that.

143
00:04:38,956 --> 00:04:38,962
No way
my Gino did that.

144
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:41,062
It's an Enzo.

145
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:43,095
He was in the shop.
You told me he was off.

146
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:44,228
So what?

147
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:46,462
So I didn't want
to hurt his feelings.

148
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,862
You can't continue
seeing him.

149
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:49,195
You're
destroying yourself.

150
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:50,428
Aah!

151
00:04:51,662 --> 00:04:53,228
I'm not gonna
let you.

152
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:54,695
Now, if you don't call him,
I will.

153
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,895
No, Kramer,
you can't do that.

154
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:58,628
No, I'm call Gino.
You'll see him.

155
00:04:58,662 --> 00:05:00,295
We're gonna get
that haircut fixed up.

156
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:01,562
I don't want you
to call him.

157
00:05:01,595 --> 00:05:03,462
All right. Gee.

158
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:05,162
You're crazy.

159
00:05:06,762 --> 00:05:07,895
So, uh...

160
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:08,956
I still haven't heard
about that job.

161
00:05:08,956 --> 00:05:09,462
I still haven't heard
about that job.

162
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:10,562
Yeah,
that's tough one.

163
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:11,628
What are you gonna do?

164
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:13,762
I have an idea.

165
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:15,262
Yeah?

166
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:16,795
I show up.

167
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:21,428
What do you mean,
you show up?

168
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:22,895
I show up.

169
00:05:22,928 --> 00:05:25,262
I pretend
I have the job.

170
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:26,928
The guy's
on vacation.

171
00:05:26,962 --> 00:05:28,628
If I have the job,
it's fine.

172
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,928
If not, by the time
he comes back,

173
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,662
I'm ensconced.

174
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:35,262
Hmm. Not bad.

175
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:37,028
What's the worst
that could happen?

176
00:05:37,062 --> 00:05:38,956
Well, you'd be embarrassed
and humiliated

177
00:05:38,956 --> 00:05:39,395
Well, you'd be embarrassed
and humiliated

178
00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:40,862
in front of a large
group of people

179
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:42,628
