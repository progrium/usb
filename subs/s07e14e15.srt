That is their motto.

00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:13,966

And old people

of the driveway...

00:42:03,845 --> 00:42:05,411

1251
00:42:05,445 --> 00:42:06,611

1252
00:42:10,411 --> 00:42:11,611
Anyway...

1253
00:42:12,645 --> 00:42:14,378
that's it.

1254
00:42:14,411 --> 00:42:15,511
Ah...

1255
00:42:21,611 --> 00:42:23,578
I'm sorry, bub.
Oh.

00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:50,578
The bags are in the car.

1259
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:51,745
I guess we'd better go.
