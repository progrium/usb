00:22:08,404 --> 00:22:10,539
...and they call it
the World Wide Web.

543
00:22:10,572 --> 00:22:12,040
You can e-mail anyone.

544
00:22:12,073 --> 00:22:13,875
What are you, a scientist?

545
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:16,545
Ah. Gotta go.
Ah.

546
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:18,414
It was great talking.
Great talking to you.

547
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:21,817
What the hell is e-mail?

548
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:25,053
How was the date?
Pretty good.

549
00:22:25,086 --> 00:22:26,688

Oh, French fries.

552
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:33,447
Baked potato. Sorry.

553
00:22:33,447 --> 00:22:34,362
Baked potato. Sorry.

554
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,733
Yeah, you stuff your sorries
in a sack, mister.

555
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:41,236
Oh, hey, hey.
Yeah. Check it out.

556
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:44,405
Man, it's packing tight.

557
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:46,307
Why are you bringing
snowballs in here for?

558
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:48,709
I need some water.
Ice it up, nice and hard.

559
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,245
Then when you throw it:

560
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:52,413
Oh, look, there's my friend FDR.

561
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:54,749
I'm gonna nail him
in the back of the head.

562
00:22:54,782 --> 00:22:55,950
It's gonna be great.

563
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,447
Hi, Elaine.
Hey.

Oh, hi. I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
I'm moving in.

569
00:23:22,004 --> 00:23:24,104
Saw your name on the buzzer.
You must be Kessler.

570
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:26,470
No, actually, it's Kramer.
Oh.

571
00:23:26,504 --> 00:23:28,637
You need any help or--?
No, thanks.

572
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,470
But I ordered a pizza,
you want some of it?

573
00:23:30,504 --> 00:23:33,137
No, no, no. I couldn't impose.

574
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:33,447
Why not?

575
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:34,470
Why not?

576
00:23:34,504 --> 00:23:36,970
We're neighbors.
What's mine is yours.

577
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,537
