1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,566
I don't belong
to a health club.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,800
I have a strict limit
on the number of naked men

3
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:06,166
I need to see in one day...

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,066
zero.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,633
That's it.

6
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,200
What is with the high level
of security

7
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:13,000
at the health clubs,
you know what I mean?

8
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:14,300
The picture ID's,
the security guards,

9
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:15,466
the people signing in and out.

10
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,833
What is this, the Kremlin?

11
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,466
I mean, the people
that have a membership

12
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,800
go twice a year.

13
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,700
Who's breaking in?

14
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:25,333
Is this a big problem,
people stealing exercise?

15
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,466
And what if they catch
the person? What then?

16
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,000
They run. It's aerobic.
Makes it even worse.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,566
They run. It's aerobic.
Makes it even worse.

18
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:40,500
Hi, Jerry.

19
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:41,633
Oh, hi, Sidra.

20
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,066
I usually last
about 10 minutes

21
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,466
on the StairMaster.

22
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Unless, of course, if someone's
stretching in front of me

23
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:48,466
in a leotard,
then I can go an hour.

24
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,566
Really?

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,200
That's why they call it
the StairMaster.

26
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:52,400
You get up there
and stare.

27
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:55,066
Well, I'm done.

28
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,900
I think I'm gonna
go take a sauna.

29
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:59,033
All right, I'll see you
Thursday night, right?

30
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:00,566
Thursday night.
Okay.

31
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,666
Good workout?

32
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:03,867
Tremendous workout.

33
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:06,000
Tremendous workout.

34
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,533
She's a pretty girl.

35
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:10,133
Tremendous girl.

36
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,133
She's the one

37
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,633
you went out with
last night?

38
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:13,966
Yeah.
I really like her.

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,433
You know, uh...
they're fake.

40
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:20,733
What? Don't say that.

41
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:21,733
Yeah,
they're fake.

42
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:23,233
How do you know?

43
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:24,500
I can tell.

44
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:25,733
You know how
you're always bragging

45
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:27,366
how you can
spot a lesbian?

46
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,300
I'm not bragging.

47
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,166
I happen to have
a very keen lesbian eye.

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,700
Hi. How you doing?

49
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:33,867
Oh, right.

50
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:35,333
Oh, right.

51
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:38,033
Come on.
Don't you think they seem

52
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:40,300
just a bit
too perfect?

53
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,400
Yes, they do.

54
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:43,966
I never knew

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,466
you were
so into breasts.

56
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,833
I thought
you were a leg man.

57
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:48,833
A leg man? Why would I
be a leg man?

58
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't need legs.
I have legs.

59
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:55,000
Have you ever seen her naked
in the locker room?

60
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:56,300
No.

61
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,900
Oh, well, then I can't
accept your testimony.

62
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:59,133
Maybe if you'd
seen her naked.

63
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,366
I don't wanna
see her naked.

64
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,966
Well, I do.

65
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,466
Well, that's
your problem.

66
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:03,867
Look, you made
the allegation.

67
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:05,066
Look, you made
the allegation.

68
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,666
The least you could do
is follow up.

69
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,066
Oh, Jerry,
what am I gonna do?

70
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,166
I'm gonna go in there,

71
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,900
I'm gonna spy on her
in the sauna?

72
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:12,066
Yes.

73
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,133
Go in there,

74
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,866
do a little
investigative journalism.

75
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,300
I need to know.

76
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,466
But a few more dates,
you can find out for yourself.

77
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,466
Don't be so sure.

78
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,466
Look at George.

79
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,133
He's on his ninth date
with Betsy,

80
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,500
he still hasn't gotten
anywhere with her.

81
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:25,800
What's his problem?

82
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,000
Every time he tries to make
a move, something screws up.

83
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:29,866
On their last date,
they were on the couch,

84
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,533
but she was sitting
on his wrong side.

85
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:32,533
"Wrong side"?

86
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:33,867
Yeah,
she was on his right side.

87
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:33,966
Yeah,
she was on his right side.

88
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,333
He can't make a move
with his left hand.

89
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,533
He can't go left.

90
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:38,866
He can't go left?

91
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,900
No.

92
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:41,966
I'm lefty, can't go right.

93
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,033
What about women,
do they go left or right?

94
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:47,900
No,
we just play defense.

95
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:53,100
Oh!

96
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:11,833
Can I ask you
a question?

97
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:15,133
Would you mind
switching seats?

98
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,833
Oh.

99
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:19,666
Actually, I'd really
prefer to sit here.

100
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,666
I don't hear very well
out of this ear,

101
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,366
so I, um...

102
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,266
always try to sit
to the right of people.

103
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,666
I'll shout.

104
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:33,666
Well, I really think

105
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:33,867
I feel
more comfortable here.

106
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:34,966
I feel
more comfortable here.

107
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,500
Come on.
Come on.

108
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:37,633
Come on, really.
Come on.

109
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,800
George!
No, come on.

110
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,066
No, I really--
Come on.

111
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,466
See, now,
is that so bad?

112
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
What?

113
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,733
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

114
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:54,966
Oh, the machine
will get it.

115
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
Oh, no, no,
it's not on.

116
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:57,966
They'll call back.

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,800
But, George, what if
it's an emergency?

118
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,700
In the whole world right now,
there's maybe three emergencies.

119
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:03,867
Why would you think,
on this entire planet,

120
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:04,500
Why would you think,
on this entire planet,

121
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:05,833
that you're one
of those three?

122
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:07,833
George, please.

123
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hello.

124
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:14,000
What?

125
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh, my God!

126
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,566
All right,
maybe four.

127
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:25,466
ELAINE:
<i>Boy... I'm really sweating.</i>

128
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,000
<i>Good sweat, beads of sweat,</i>
<i>sweating bullets.</i>

129
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,866
<i>Look at her.</i>

130
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,867
<i>I don't need to see her naked</i>
<i>to know those aren't real.</i>

131
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:34,000
<i>I don't need to see her naked</i>
<i>to know those aren't real.</i>

132
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:36,733
<i>Why'd she even tie the towel</i>
<i>around her?</i>

133
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:39,400
<i>She's got a rack on her chest.</i>

134
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:42,900
<i>Oh, God.</i>

135
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:45,166
<i>Sidra's taking the towel off.</i>

136
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,133
<i>Whoa, doctor!</i>

137
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,566
<i>That's it.</i>

138
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,733
<i>I knew it. I knew it.</i>
<i>They're definitely fake.</i>

139
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:56,100
So when's
the funeral?

140
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:58,400
Well...

141
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:00,633
Aunt Clarisse
was so ill,

142
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,867
I-- I guess
it was really a blessing.

143
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:04,100
I-- I guess
it was really a blessing.

144
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,833
Yeah, I'll fly home
as soon as I can.

145
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,700
Okay.

146
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:25,666
You too. Get some sleep.

147
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,466
JERRY:
You sure?

148
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:33,867
Positive.

149
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:34,633
Positive.

150
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,166
This chick's playing
with Confederate money.

151
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,133
Well, then, that's it.
That's the end of that.

152
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,200
What, just because
of that?

153
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,633
"Just because
of that?"

154
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,066
It's like finding out
Mickey Mantle corked his bat.

155
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,166
Oh, come on.

156
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,233
You've dated women
with nose jobs.

157
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,466
What's the difference?

158
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,466
You don't touch the nose,

159
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,800
you don't aspire
to reach the nose,

160
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,900
you don't unhook anything
to get to a nose,

161
00:05:56,933 --> 00:06:00,366
and no man has ever tried
to look up a woman's nostrils.

162
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:03,867
You've put a lot of thought
into this, haven't you?

163
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:06,066
You've put a lot of thought
into this, haven't you?

164
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,800
Well, I take it
very seriously.

165
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,133
You know,
sometimes when I think

166
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,166
you're the shallowest man
I've ever met,

167
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,866
you somehow manage to drain
a little more out of the pool.

168
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:18,900
Hey.
Hey.

169
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:20,166
Hey.

170
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,200
Hey.
Hey.

171
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:24,866
You know, I do
kind of wonder

172
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,200
what fake breasts
feel like.

173
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:28,633
Well, I know
what they feel like.

174
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,900
You? How do you know?

175
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:31,133
Well, I lived
in Los Angeles

176
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,966
for three months.

177
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,867
I thought you hated Los Angeles.

178
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:35,300

Yep, and in two days,
I'm off to Puerto Rico.

Hey, Kramer, by the way,

at the health club.

362
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,500
That is not Salman Rushdie.

363
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,333
Pfft! Wrong.

364
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:45,566
There's Sidra.

365
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,800
There's Salman.

366
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,133
Where?
Talking to that woman.

367

368

If that's Sidra,
she's talking to Salman.

369

Well, I don't think
they're real.

Instead of salmon,
he went with bass.

one fish for another.

scrapbook of her life.

could have and hold on to.

You're interrupting.

531
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,358
Oh, well, you know, I'm, uh,
I'm packing for Puerto Rico.

532
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:23,691
I need to borrow
your bathing suit.

533
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:25,024
This is an emergency?

534
00:19:25,058 --> 00:19:26,391
You need
a bathing suit?

535
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:27,758
Well, I like yours.

536
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:30,991
I don't know--
My bathing suit?

537
00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:33,024
That's a little familiar.

538
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:36,284
I don't want your--
your boys down there.

539
00:19:36,284 --> 00:19:37,824
I don't want your--
your boys down there.

540
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:44,358
Now, what's the matter
with my boys?

541
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:48,691
Your boys should stay
in their neighborhood.

542
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:50,824
All right. Come on!

543
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:51,858
All right.

544
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:52,858
It's in
the top drawer.

545
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,224
Hurry up.

546
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:56,858
Hi, Jer.

547
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,358
Oh, hi, Elaine.

548
00:19:58,391 --> 00:20:00,391
Oh, hi, Sidra.

549
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:02,058
Hi. Elaine?

550
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:05,224
Uh...
Hey.

551
00:20:05,258 --> 00:20:06,284
Well, what are you doing here?

552
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:06,558
Well, what are you doing here?

553
00:20:06,591 --> 00:20:07,724
I'm looking
for Kramer.

554
00:20:07,758 --> 00:20:09,024
Oh, uh, what's going on?

555
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:10,191
She was showing me pictures

556
00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:12,391
of places I could visit
when I go to Puerto Rico.

557
00:20:12,424 --> 00:20:13,624
You know,
when you two went?

558
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:16,124
Oh, yeah. All right.
Well, just, uh....

559
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:17,791
You know, the--

560
00:20:17,824 --> 00:20:18,991
Yeah, yeah.
All right.

561
00:20:19,024 --> 00:20:20,224
[DOOR SHUTS]

562
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,191
So where were we?

563
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,691
I was just leaving.

564
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:28,324
Right. You were leaving.

565
00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:29,691
I can't believe
you sent a woman

566
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:32,524
into the sauna
to do that.

567
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:33,658
That was an accident!

568
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,624
I think you're both
mentally ill.

569
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:36,284
Oh!

570
00:20:36,284 --> 00:20:37,558
Oh!

571
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:45,391
And, by the way,

572
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:48,658
they're real,
and they're spectacular.

573
00:20:50,024 --> 00:20:52,358
BETSY:
Stop it, George! Get out! Get out!

574
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:54,024
I never want
to see you again!

575
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:55,458
FATHER JESSUP:
Go back to New York!

576
00:20:55,491 --> 00:20:57,191
Get out! Get out!

577
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:00,524
All right, sir.

578
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:02,191
Now, all I need
is a death certificate,

579
00:21:02,224 --> 00:21:04,524
and you'll be
on your way.

580
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:05,791
Well, you see,

581
00:21:05,824 --> 00:21:06,284
what happened
was, um...

582
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:08,124
what happened
was, um...

583
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:11,124
the doctor,
the very same doctor

584
00:21:11,158 --> 00:21:14,224
that was attending
my late aunt suffered...

585
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:16,691
an untimely stroke

586
00:21:16,724 --> 00:21:20,358
and, uh, lost the use
of his right hand,

587
00:21:20,391 --> 00:21:24,358
so, obviously, I was unable
to get the death certificate.

588
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:27,224
Um, however, I--
I do have this.

589
00:21:28,724 --> 00:21:29,958
What's this?

590
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:32,158
That's a picture of me
next to the coffin.

591
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:34,324
WOMAN:
Nice try.

592
00:21:34,358 --> 00:21:35,391
GEORGE:
Not even close, huh?

593
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:36,284
WOMAN:
No.

594
00:21:36,284 --> 00:21:37,391
WOMAN:
No.

595
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:42,991
The cosmetic surgery procedures

596
00:21:43,024 --> 00:21:44,658
that are available to people
today--

597
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:46,524
Liposuction,
are you familiar with this?

598
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:49,124
This is a fat-sucking machine.

599
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:51,324
Now, you know, somewhere,
somebody is working on a way

600
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:54,391
that this thing
could go into a restaurant.

601
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:56,358
And you could just
order it off the menu:

602
00:21:56,391 --> 00:21:57,958
"I'll tell you what.
Give me the cheesecake.

603
00:21:57,991 --> 00:21:59,358
"crank me up to nine,

604
00:21:59,391 --> 00:22:03,058
and put a scoop of ice cream
on the side."
