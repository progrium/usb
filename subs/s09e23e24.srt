Anyway, let me tell you
why I called.

199
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:06,320
When I took over here
last month,

200
00:07:06,354 --> 00:07:06,411
I reviewed what was
in development

201
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:07,856
I reviewed what was
in development

202
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:09,690
and it was pretty much
same old, same old.

203
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:11,258
Been there,
done that.

204
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,426
Right. I was looking
for something different.

205
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,928
Something that would
have people talking at the water coolers.

206
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:17,196
Water coolers?

207
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,066
We call it
a water-cooler show.

208
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,567
Because the next day
in the offices,

209
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,334
people gather around
the water coolers

210
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:24,535
to talk about it,
right?

00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,937
GEORGE:
Huh.

212
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:27,405
I would think people
would talk about it

213
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:29,339
at the, uh,
coffee machines.

214
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:31,909
Well, it's probably
just easier to say water cooler show

215
00:07:31,942 --> 00:07:34,010
than coffee machine show.

216
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:35,211
It's really
not accurate.

Plane's ready.

696
00:24:37,256 --> 00:24:39,525
[♪]

697
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:46,697
I'm Geraldo Rivera.
Tonight we'll be talking about

698
00:24:46,731 --> 00:24:49,900
what most of you have probably
been discussing in your homes

699
00:24:49,933 --> 00:24:52,368
and around the water coolers
in your offices.

700
00:24:52,402 --> 00:24:54,437
I'm speaking, of course,
of the controversial

701
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,071
Good Samaritan trial

702
00:24:56,105 --> 00:24:58,707
that gets underway Thursday
in Latham, Massachusetts.

703
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,742
Now, before we meet
our distinguished panel,

704
00:25:00,775 --> 00:25:02,110
let's go to Latham live

705
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:04,212
where Jane Wells
is standing by. Jane.

706
00:25:04,245 --> 00:25:05,294
Yes, good evening,
Geraldo.

707
00:25:05,294 --> 00:25:05,746
Yes, good evening,
Geraldo.

708
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:07,781
<i>What's the mood?</i>
<i>What's going on tonight?</i>

709
00:25:07,815 --> 00:25:10,250
<i>Well, Latham is</i>
<i>fairly quiet tonight</i>

710
00:25:10,283 --> 00:25:11,784
considering
the media circus

711
00:25:11,818 --> 00:25:14,186
that has descended upon
this quaint little town.

712
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,556
And what about the defendants,
the so-called New York Four?

713
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:18,957
How are they holding up?

714
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,026
Well, I did speak with
one of the deputies

715
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,395
who has some contact with them
and he told me, quote:

716
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:26,764
"There's no love lost
with that group."

717
00:25:26,797 --> 00:25:28,065
Anything else, Jane?

718
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:30,067
There also seems to be
some friction

719
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,368
between Mr. Seinfeld
and Ms. Benes.

720
00:25:32,401 --> 00:25:34,237
The rumor is
that they once dated

721
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,294
and it's possible
that ended badly.

722
00:25:35,294 --> 00:25:36,572
and it's possible
that ended badly.

723
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:38,240
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
who knows,

724
00:25:38,273 --> 00:25:41,043
maybe this trial will
bring them closer together.

725
00:25:41,076 --> 00:25:43,611
Maybe they'll even end up
getting married.

726
00:25:43,645 --> 00:25:45,379
[♪]

727
00:25:45,412 --> 00:25:47,048
HELEN:
I hope you packed enough.

728
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:48,649
This trial could last
for weeks.

729
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:50,150
What's all that?

730
00:25:50,183 --> 00:25:51,251
Cereal.

731
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:52,485
You're packing
cereal?

732
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,387
I'm bringing it
for Jerry.

733
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,888
You got enough for
a life sentence.

734
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,256
He likes it.

735
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,623
Says he misses
that more than anything.

736
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,325
So bring
a snack pack.

737
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,726
Poor Georgie.

738
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,928
Was it our fault
this happened to him?

739
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,294
Did we
do something wrong?

740
00:26:05,294 --> 00:26:05,996
Did we
do something wrong?

741
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:07,998
Maybe it <i>was</i>
our fault.

742
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:09,599
Maybe it was your fault.

743
00:26:09,632 --> 00:26:11,568
Wasn't my fault,
I can tell you that.

744
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:14,771
Oh, so it was my fault
but not yours.

745
00:26:14,804 --> 00:26:16,472
You were the one
who smothered him.

746
00:26:16,505 --> 00:26:17,839
I did not
smother him.

747
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:19,307
You smothered.

748
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,142
He couldn't get any air.
He couldn't breathe.

749
00:26:21,176 --> 00:26:22,510
He was suffocating!

750
00:26:22,543 --> 00:26:24,845
Sure, and you were
always in Korea

751
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:26,947
with your
religious chachkas.

752
00:26:26,981 --> 00:26:28,848
I had to make
a living!

753
00:26:28,882 --> 00:26:31,084

757
00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:26,396
This is excellent, huh?
Mm.

758
00:27:27,998 --> 00:27:29,699
Don't worry,
I didn't use too much milk

759
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:32,335
'cause I know
we gotta make it last.

760
00:27:32,368 --> 00:27:34,503
You know, I've had to reduce
my milk level.

761
00:27:34,537 --> 00:27:35,294
I've always filled
to at least three quarters,

762
00:27:35,294 --> 00:27:36,639
I've always filled
to at least three quarters,

763
00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:38,073
sometimes to the top
of the cereal.

764
00:27:38,106 --> 00:27:40,975
Now, to conserve, I can't even
see the milk anymore.

765
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:43,745
It's a big adjustment.
I bet.

766
00:27:43,778 --> 00:27:46,447
It's one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do.

767
00:27:48,582 --> 00:27:49,750
Good morning.

768
00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:51,351
There you are.
Good morning, Jackie.

769
00:27:51,384 --> 00:27:53,986
JERRY: Good morning.
Is everybody ready?

770
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:56,555
Didn't I tell you I wanted you
to wear the cardigan?

771
00:27:56,588 --> 00:27:58,390
Makes me look older.

772
00:27:58,423 --> 00:27:59,524
Look older?

773
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:00,659
You think this
is a game?

774
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:01,860
That what you think
this is?

775
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:03,527
I'm trying to give you
a moral compass.

776
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:04,895
You have no
moral compass.

777
00:28:04,928 --> 00:28:05,294
You're gonna walk
into that courtroom

778
00:28:05,294 --> 00:28:06,363
You're gonna walk
into that courtroom

779
00:28:06,396 --> 00:28:09,199
and the jury's gonna see
a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza.

780
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:10,700
I want 'em
to see Perry Como.

781
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:12,535
No one's gonna convict
Perry Como.

782
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:15,171
Perry Como helps out a fat tub
who's getting robbed.

No.

786
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:21,676
You damn right
it isn't.

787
00:28:21,709 --> 00:28:24,078
You better not be laughing
in that courtroom, funnyman.

788
00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:26,013
If you start getting
all smart-alecky,

789
00:28:26,046 --> 00:28:28,282
making wisecracks,
acting a fool,

790
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:31,417
you're gonna find yourself
in here for a long, long time.

791
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,586
I don't like
that tie.

792
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:35,294
Susie, get one of <i>my</i> ties
from my briefcase.

793
00:28:35,294 --> 00:28:36,622
Susie, get one of <i>my</i> ties
from my briefcase.

00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:37,956
How do I look, Jackie?

795
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,657
Oh, you looking good.

796
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:43,594
You look strong.

797
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:45,596
You one fine-looking,
sexy lady.

798
00:28:46,663 --> 00:28:48,699
Thank you, Jackie.

799
00:28:48,732 --> 00:28:49,900
What about me, Jackie?

800
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:51,767
Kramer,
you always look good.

801
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:54,403
You got respect for yourself.
You're genuine.

802
00:28:54,436 --> 00:28:55,737
Jury's gonna
pick up on that.

803
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,805
[CHUCKLING]
Yeah.

00:28:56,838 --> 00:28:57,906
Whoo.

805
00:28:57,939 --> 00:28:59,474
Here.

806
00:28:59,508 --> 00:29:01,375
This one?
That's right.

807
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:02,443
Do I have to?

808
00:29:02,476 --> 00:29:05,078

All rise.

812
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:10,317
Fourth District
County Court,

813
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,318
Latham, Massachusetts
is now in session.

814
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:15,821
The Honorable Judge
Arthur Vandelay presiding.

815
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,489
Vandelay?

816
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:19,824
The judge's name is Vandelay?
Vanda-who?

817
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:21,826
Jerry, did you hear that?
Yeah, yeah.

818
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:23,260
I think that's a good sign.

819
00:29:23,293 --> 00:29:26,163
Is the district attorney
ready to proceed?

820
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:28,164
We are, Your Honor.

821
00:29:28,197 --> 00:29:29,766
Mr. Hoyt.

822
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:34,637
Ladies and gentlemen,
last year our city council

823
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,294
by a vote of 12-to-2,
passed a Good Samaritan law.

824
00:29:35,294 --> 00:29:37,905
by a vote of 12-to-2,
passed a Good Samaritan law.

825
00:29:37,939 --> 00:29:40,274
Now, essentially,
we made it a crime

826
00:29:40,307 --> 00:29:42,977
to ignore a fellow human being
in trouble.

827
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:46,012
Now,
this group from New York

828
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:48,949
not only ignored,
but as we will prove,

829
00:29:48,982 --> 00:29:52,058
they actually mocked
the victim

830
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:54,527
as he was being robbed
at gunpoint.

831
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,230
I can guarantee you one other
thing, ladies and gentlemen,

832
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:02,199
this is not the first time
they have behaved in this manner.

833
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:03,734
On the contrary.

834
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,294
They have quite a record
of mocking and maligning.

835
00:30:05,294 --> 00:30:06,803
They have quite a record
of mocking and maligning.

836
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:10,640
This is a history of
selfishness, self-absorption,

837
00:30:10,673 --> 00:30:13,675
immaturity and greed.

838
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:16,711
And you will see how everyone

839
00:30:16,745 --> 00:30:20,014
who has come into contact
with these four individuals

840
00:30:20,048 --> 00:30:23,150
has been abused, wronged,

841
00:30:23,183 --> 00:30:26,219
deceived and betrayed.

842
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:28,721
This time...

843
00:30:28,755 --> 00:30:31,557
they have gone
too far.

844
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,259
This time...

845
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:35,294
they are going to be
held accountable.

846
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:36,027
they are going to be
held accountable.

847
00:30:36,061 --> 00:30:37,595
This time...

848
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:41,866
they are the ones
who will pay.

849
00:30:44,534 --> 00:30:46,870
Mr. Chiles?

850
00:30:46,903 --> 00:30:49,572
I am shocked
and chagrined.

851
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,408
Mortified and stupefied.

852
00:30:53,442 --> 00:30:55,377
This trial is outrageous.

853
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,680
It is a waste of
the taxpayers' time and money.

854
00:30:58,713 --> 00:31:01,382
It is a travesty of justice
that these four people

855
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:04,217
have been incarcerated
while the real perpetrator

856
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,294
is walking around laughing.

857
00:31:05,294 --> 00:31:06,687
is walking around laughing.

858
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,421
Lying and laughing.

859
00:31:08,454 --> 00:31:11,056
Laughing...and lying.

860
00:31:12,057 --> 00:31:13,692
Do you know what
these four people were?

861
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:16,227
They were
innocent bystanders.

862
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,029
Now, you just think about
that term.

863
00:31:18,062 --> 00:31:19,063
Innocent...

864
00:31:19,097 --> 00:31:21,465
bystanders.

865
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:23,200
Because that's exactly
what they were.

866
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:25,868
We know they were bystanders,
nobody's disputing that.

867
00:31:25,902 --> 00:31:28,237
So how can a bystander
be guilty? No such thing.

868
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,207
Have you ever heard

we have.

1393
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:32,371
Yeah,
maybe we have.

1394
00:54:32,404 --> 00:54:34,606
[♪]

1395
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:45,048
So, what is the deal
with the yard?

1396
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:47,450
When I was a kid, my mother
wanted me to play in the yard

1397
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:49,718
but she didn't have to worry
about my neighbor

1398
00:54:49,752 --> 00:54:51,920
sticking a shiv in my thigh.

[LAUGHING]

1400
00:54:53,021 --> 00:54:54,489
Whoo!

1401
00:54:54,522 --> 00:54:55,923
What's with the lockdown?

1402
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:57,792
Why do we have to be
locked in our cells?

1403
00:54:57,825 --> 00:55:01,128
Are we that bad
that we have to be sent to prison in prison?

1404
00:55:01,162 --> 00:55:02,763
You would think
the weightlifting

1405
00:55:02,796 --> 00:55:04,465
and the sodomy is enough.

1406
00:55:04,498 --> 00:55:06,933
[LAUGHING]

1407
00:55:06,967 --> 00:55:08,834
So, uh,
anyone from Cellblock D?

1408
00:55:08,868 --> 00:55:09,902
MAN 1:
I am.

1409
00:55:09,935 --> 00:55:10,970
I'll talk slower.

1410
00:55:11,003 --> 00:55:11,195
[CHUCKLES]

1411
00:55:11,195 --> 00:55:12,271
[CHUCKLES]

1412
00:55:12,304 --> 00:55:13,972
I'm kidding.
I love Cellblock D.

1413
00:55:14,006 --> 00:55:15,940
My friend George
is in Cellblock D.

1414
00:55:18,809 --> 00:55:19,843
What are you in for, sir?

1415
00:55:19,877 --> 00:55:20,944
MAN 2:
Murder one.

1416
00:55:20,978 --> 00:55:21,979
Murder one.

1417
00:55:22,012 --> 00:55:23,446
Ooh.

1418
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,482
Watch out, everybody.
Better be nice to you.

1419
00:55:25,515 --> 00:55:27,650
I'm only kidding, sir.
Lighten up.

1420
00:55:27,684 --> 00:55:28,818
How about you?

1421
00:55:28,851 --> 00:55:29,819
MAN 3:
Grand theft auto.

1422
00:55:29,852 --> 00:55:30,987
Grand theft auto.

1423
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,654
Don't steal any
of my jokes.

1424
00:55:32,775 --> 00:55:34,275
MAN 3:
You suck. I'm gonna cut you.

1425
00:55:34,308 --> 00:55:36,575
Hey, I don't knock
the license plate out of your hand.

1426
00:55:36,608 --> 00:55:38,941
All right, Seinfeld,
that's it. Let's go. Come on.

1427
00:55:38,975 --> 00:55:40,708
All right.
Hey, you've been great.

1428
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:41,195
See you in the cafeteria.

1429
00:55:41,195 --> 00:55:42,241
See you in the cafeteria.
