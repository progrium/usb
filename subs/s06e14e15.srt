Oh, hi.

3
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:34,065
A hundred episodes.

4
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:35,565
That's a lot.

5
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:38,132
During the course of which
George, Elaine, Kramer, and I

6
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:42,332
have had many experiences,
both positive and negative.

7
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:44,165
Well, mostly negative.

8
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:45,799
There have been
some relationships

9
00:00:45,832 --> 00:00:46,999
that haven't worked out.

10
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:48,699
Ambitions that were
unfulfilled.

11
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:50,999
Hopes dashed.

12
00:00:51,032 --> 00:00:53,632
Some property damage.
Hurt feelings.

13
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:55,234
I know one guy got deported.

14
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:55,632
I know one guy got deported.

15
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:57,699
Physical injury and...

16
00:00:57,732 --> 00:01:00,065
all right,
maybe even a death or two.

17
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:04,165

And for 30 minutes a week,

20
00:01:08,065 --> 00:01:09,865
that's pretty important to us.

00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:11,399
So if you're joining us late,

22
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:14,665
here's some highlights
from what's happened so far.

23
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,732
Why don't they have salsa
on the table?

24
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:19,132
What do you need salsa for?

25
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:22,165
Salsa is now the number-one
condiment in America.

26
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:23,799
Do you know why?

27
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:25,234
Because people like
to say "salsa."

28
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:25,865
Because people like
to say "salsa."

29
00:01:27,732 --> 00:01:29,232
Excuse me.
Do you have any salsa?

30
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:32,032
We need more salsa.
Where's the salsa? No salsa?

31
00:01:32,065 --> 00:01:35,299
You know, it must be
impossible for a Spanish person

32
00:01:35,332 --> 00:01:38,899
to order seltzer
and not get salsa.

33
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,632
I wanted seltzer, not salsa.

34
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:44,132
Don't you know the difference
between seltzer and salsa?

35
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:46,399
You have the seltzer
after the salsa.

36
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:49,032
See? This should be the show.
This is the show.

00:01:49,932 --> 00:01:51,032

Yeah. Right.

00:01:58,265 --> 00:02:00,499
No, I'm really serious.
I think that's a good idea.

00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:03,799

Well, what's the show about?

00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,232
It's about nothing.

52
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:33,399
No, forget the story.

53
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:34,999

Why is that?

142
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:50,032
Because the mail
never stops.

181
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,532
Oh, 'cause a lot of times
I write in bed,

182
00:06:59,565 --> 00:07:02,865
and I have to turn and lean on
my elbow to make the pen work.

183
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:05,332
Take the pen.

184
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:06,399
Oh, no.

185
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:07,665
Go ahead.
I couldn't.

186
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,065
Come on. Take the pen.

187
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:10,399
I can't take it.
Do me a personal favor.

188
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:11,899
I'm not comfortable.
Take the pen!

189
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,332
I cannot take it.
Take the pen!

190
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:15,299
Are you sure?
I'm positive!

191
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:16,699
Take the pen.

192
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:18,199
Okay.
All right.

193
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:20,032
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

194
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,232
Gee! Boy.

195
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:22,632
Jack, what are you doing?

196
00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:23,699
Stop it.

197
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:24,865
Jack,
we should go.

198
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:28,965
It was nice
meeting you.

199
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:30,299
Mmm.
Nice to meet you.

200
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:31,399
Thanks again,
Jack.

201
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:32,732
Come on!

202
00:07:36,932 --> 00:07:38,432
This?

203
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:41,299
I agreed to wear this?

204
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:42,732
Yeah, yeah.

205
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,365
Well, when did I do that?

206
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,899
When we went to dinner
the other night.

207
00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:49,732
What are you, crazy?

208
00:07:49,765 --> 00:07:52,199
What were you talkin' about
when I went to the bathroom?

209
00:07:52,232 --> 00:07:53,665
I don't know.

210
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,132
I couldn't understand
a word she was saying.

211
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:55,234
I was just nodding.

212
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:56,232
I was just nodding.

213
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:58,399
Pow! There you go.

214
00:07:58,432 --> 00:07:59,899
Where I go?

215
00:07:59,932 --> 00:08:02,899
You mean she was asking me
to wear this ridiculous shirt

216
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:04,732
on national TV and I said yes?

217
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:06,232
Yes.
Yes, you said it.

218
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:08,132
But I didn't know
what she was talking about.

219
00:08:08,165 --> 00:08:09,465
I couldn't hear her.

220
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:10,832
Well, she asked you.

221
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,799
I-I can't wear this
puffy shirt on TV.

222
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:16,999
I mean, look at it.
It looks ridiculous.

223
00:08:17,032 --> 00:08:18,965
Well, you gotta wear it now.

224
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,365
This pirate trend that
she's come up with, Jerry,

225
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,399
this is gonna be
the new look for the '90s.

226
00:08:23,432 --> 00:08:25,234
You're gonna be
the first pirate.

227
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:25,399
You're gonna be
the first pirate.

228
00:08:25,432 --> 00:08:27,899
But I don't wanna
be a pirate.

229
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:30,399
I don't understand.
Do you have my reservation?

230
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:31,499
Yes, we do.

231
00:08:31,532 --> 00:08:33,299
Unfortunately,
we ran out of cars.

232
00:08:33,332 --> 00:08:36,399
But the reservation
keeps the car here.

233
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,732
That's why you have
the reservation.

234
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:40,899
I know why
we have reservations.

235
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:42,265
I don't think you do.

236
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:49,232
If you did, I'd have a car.

237
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:51,165
So you know how to <i>take</i>
the reservation.

238
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,899
You just don't know how
to <i>hold</i> the reservation.

239
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:55,234
And that's really

240
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,399
And that's really

241
00:08:56,432 --> 00:08:59,165
the most important part
of the reservation,

242
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,232
the holding.

243
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:02,199
Anybody can just take 'em.

244
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:13,744
I think I can sum up the show
for you with one word.

245
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:16,444
Nothing!

246
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:19,111
Nothing?

247
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:20,411
Nothing!

248
00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:21,544
What does that mean?

249
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:23,444
What did you do today?

250
00:09:23,478 --> 00:09:24,644
I got up and came to work.

251
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:26,078
There's a show.
That's a show.

252
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:29,044
How is that a show?

253
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:31,311
Well, uh, m-maybe
something happens to you

254
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:32,478
on the way to work.

255
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:35,411
No. No. No!
Nothing happens!

256
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:35,545
Well, something happens.

257
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:37,578
Well, something happens.

258
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,144
Well, why am I watching it?

259
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,011
Because it's on TV.

260
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:43,078
Not yet.

261
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:45,911

262
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:02,311

she's good-looking.

00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:04,644
What about the body?
What kinda body?

Really, very nice and good.

What about person--?

271
00:10:17,844 --> 00:10:21,478
Good personality.

Funny.

273

Bright.

274
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:26,044
Smarter than me? I don't want
anyone smarter than me.

275
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,311
How could she be
smarter than you?

[LAUGHING]
Oh, no, he's a really, really funny guy.

What does he look like?

279
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:36,878
Pardon?

What does he look like?

281

Well, he's got a lot of
character in his face.

Um, he's short.
Um, he's stocky.

00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,578
He's fat.

Is that what you're saying?
That he's fat?

286
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:51,311
Powerful.

287
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:52,811
He is so powerful!

288
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:57,378
He can lift 100 pounds
right up over his head.

289
00:10:57,411 --> 00:10:58,644
And, um...

290

losing his hair.

297
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:08,811
He's bald?!

298
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:10,411
No!

299
00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:12,078
No, no, no.

300
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:13,778
He's not bald.

301
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:15,711
He's balding.

302
00:11:15,744 --> 00:11:17,211
So he will be bald.

303
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,144
Yeah.

304
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,511
Thick, lustrous hair
is very important to me.

305
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:30,078
"Thick, lustrous hair
is very important to me."

306
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:31,144
Is that what you said?

307
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:32,244
Yeah, that's right.

308
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:34,644
Just clarifying.

309
00:11:34,678 --> 00:11:35,545
Lemme ask you this.

310
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:35,811
Lemme ask you this.

311
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:43,778
If you stick your hand
in the hair,

312
00:11:43,811 --> 00:11:46,244
is it easy to get it out?

313
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:50,944
Do you wanna be able
to get it out,

314
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:53,911
or do you wanna not be able
to get it out?

315
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:55,311
I'd like to be able
to get it out.

316
00:11:55,344 --> 00:11:57,911
I think you'll get it out.

317
00:11:57,944 --> 00:11:59,478
What about the skin?

318
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,511
I need a good cheek.
I like a good cheek.

319
00:12:02,611 --> 00:12:03,878
She's got a fine cheek.

320
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:05,545
Is there a pinkish hue?

321
00:12:05,545 --> 00:12:06,478
Is there a pinkish hue?

322
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:10,478
A pinkish hue?

323
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:13,478
Yes. A rosy glow.

324
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:16,644
There's a hue.

325
00:12:16,678 --> 00:12:18,111
She's got great eyebrows.

326
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:20,578
Women kill to have
her eyebrows.

327
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:24,111
Who cares about eyebrows?

328
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,111
Look at you.

329
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:30,211
Why don't you do something
with your life?!

330
00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:31,911
Sit around here all day.

331
00:12:31,944 --> 00:12:34,244
You contribute nothing
to society.

332
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:35,545
The alarm didn't go off,
it's 9:15!

333
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:36,044
The alarm didn't go off,
it's 9:15!

9:15?

Yeah, 9:15!

Eh, we'll never make it.
I'll leave tomorrow.

Tomorrow? Are you crazy?!

00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:45,778
No. Now, now.

Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

You get dressed.
You get dressed.

How could I be with
someone like you?

343
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:55,378
Wouldn't respect myself.

344
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:56,644
Put your pants on.

345
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:58,211
I'll go tomorrow
or the next day.

346
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,711
No, you have your ticket.
You have to go now.

347
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:00,778
We'll never make it.

348

Don't say that.

Well, it takes 45 minutes

It takes 45 minutes

It takes 45 minutes
to get there,

00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,644
that will only leave me
5 minutes to get to the plane.

00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,544
the "it's not you,
it's me" routine?

360
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:28,244
I invented
"it's not you, it's me."

361
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:30,744
Nobody tells me
it's them, not me.

362
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:32,211
If it's anybody, it's me.

363
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,478
All right.

364
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:34,611
George, it's you.

365
00:13:34,644 --> 00:13:35,545
You're damn right it's me.

366
00:13:35,545 --> 00:13:37,144
You're damn right it's me.

367
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:38,444
Elaine...
Hm?

368
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:41,544
you don't know the first thing
about first base.

369
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:46,044
Oh. Well, I know something
about gettin' to first base.

370
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:48,811
And I know you'll
never be there.

371
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:50,978
The way I figure it,
I've already been there.

372
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:54,378
I plan on rounding second
tonight at around 11:00.

373
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:55,611
[LAUGHS]

374
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:56,811
Well, uh...

375
00:13:56,844 --> 00:13:59,911
I'd watch the third-base coach
if I were you,

376
00:13:59,944 --> 00:14:04,311
'cause I don't think
he's wavin' you in.

377
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,545
I guess things changed for me
on Tuesday night.

378
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,044
I guess things changed for me
on Tuesday night.

379
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:08,378
Tuesday night?

380
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:10,078
What happened
Tuesday night?

381
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:13,378
I saw your act.

382
00:14:13,411 --> 00:14:16,311
My act? Wh-what does that
have to do with anything?

383
00:14:16,344 --> 00:14:18,378
To be honest, it...

384
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:20,478
just didn't make it for me.

385
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:23,411
It was just so much fluff.

386
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:24,644
So, what're you saying?

387
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:26,244
You didn't like my act?

388
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:27,778
So that's it?

389
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:31,244
I can't be with someone
if I don't respect what they do.

390
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:33,144
You're a cashier.

391
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:35,545
You don't know my name,
do you?

392
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:35,978
You don't know my name,
do you?

393
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:38,211
Yes, I do.

394
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,478
What is it?

395
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,911
It rhymes with
a female body part.

396
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:44,278
What is it?

397
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:47,344
Mulva?

398
00:14:49,344 --> 00:14:51,978
I think you're really sick.

399
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:53,311
I'm not sick.

400
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:56,144
You said much sicker
things than me.

401
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:57,278
I'm leaving.

402
00:14:57,311 --> 00:14:58,711
So, where were we?

403
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:00,111
I was just leaving.

404
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:01,944
Right.
You were leaving.

405
00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:05,411
I can't believe you sent
a woman into the sauna to do that.

406
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:05,545
That was an accident.

407
00:15:05,545 --> 00:15:07,144
That was an accident.

408
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:09,278
I think you're both
mentally ill.

409
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,311
Ohhh...

410
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:18,811
And by the way...

411
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:23,444
they're real,
and they're spectacular.

412
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:25,811
Why shouldn't we be able
to do that once in a while

413
00:15:25,844 --> 00:15:26,911
if we want to?

414
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:28,278
I know!

415
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:30,311
I mean, really,
what is the big deal?

416
00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:31,644
We go in there,

417
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:33,544
we're in there
for a while,

418
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:35,545
and then we come back
out here.

419
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:35,644
and then we come back
out here.

420
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:37,444
That's not complicated.

421
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,478
It's almost stupid
if we didn't.

422
00:15:39,511 --> 00:15:40,811
It's moronic!

423
00:15:40,844 --> 00:15:42,844
Absurd!

424
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,644
Of course...

425
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:51,544
I guess, maybe, some little
problems could arise.

426
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:53,378
Ah, you know,
there are always a few.

427
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,744
I mean, if anything happened,

428
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:58,311
and we couldn't be friends
the way we are now...

429
00:15:58,344 --> 00:15:59,911
that would really be bad.

430
00:15:59,944 --> 00:16:01,078
Devastating.

431
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:03,911
Because this...
is very good.

432
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:08,578
And that would be good.

433
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:11,411
That would be good too.

434
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:14,478
The idea is to combine
the this...

435
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:16,811
and the that...

436
00:16:16,844 --> 00:16:19,478
but this cannot
be disturbed.

437
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,311
Yeah. We-- We--
We just wanna take this...

438
00:16:22,344 --> 00:16:23,711
and...

439
00:16:23,744 --> 00:16:25,511
add that.

440
00:16:28,444 --> 00:16:31,244
But of course,
we have to figure out a way

441
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,244
to avoid the things that cause
the little problems.

442
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:35,545
Mmm.
Maybe some rules or something.

443
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:36,311
Mmm.
Maybe some rules or something.

444
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:37,611
Huh.

445
00:16:37,644 --> 00:16:39,111
For example...

446
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:42,744
now, I call you
whenever I am inclined

447
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:44,144
and vice versa.
Right.

448
00:16:44,178 --> 00:16:47,478
But if we did that,
we might feel...

449
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:49,078
a certain obligation to call.

450
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:51,944
Oh-- Well, why should that be?

451
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,478
Oh! I have an idea.
I have an idea.

452
00:16:54,511 --> 00:16:59,078
No calls the day after that.

453
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:00,744
Beautiful.

454
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:02,144
Let's make it a rule.

455
00:17:02,178 --> 00:17:03,911
All right, sir.

456
00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:08,411
Now, here's
another little rule.

457
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,744
Yeah.

458
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,144
When we see each other now,

459
00:17:11,178 --> 00:17:13,811
we retire
to our separate quarters.

460
00:17:13,844 --> 00:17:17,078
But sometimes, when people
get involved with that,

461
00:17:17,111 --> 00:17:20,478
they feel...
pressure to...

462
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:22,578
sleep over...

463
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:26,411
when that is not really sleep.

464
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:31,478
Sleep is separate from that,

465
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:33,078
and I don't see

466
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:35,545
why sleep got all tied up
and connected...

467
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:39,044
why sleep got all tied up
and connected...

468
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:40,478
with that.

469
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:42,311
Okay. Okay.

470
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:46,678
Rule number two:
spending the night is optional.

471
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:51,144
Well, now we're gettin'
somewhere.

472
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:52,744
I slept with Elaine
last night.

473
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:57,978
Oxygen.

474
00:17:58,011 --> 00:17:59,744
I need some oxygen.

475
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:00,811
I thought you'd like that.

476
00:18:00,844 --> 00:18:02,544
Oh, this is huge.

477
00:18:02,578 --> 00:18:03,911
I know.
All right.

478
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:05,545
Okay. Let's go. Details.

479
00:18:05,545 --> 00:18:06,311
Okay. Let's go. Details.

480
00:18:06,344 --> 00:18:07,978
No, I can't give details.

481
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:09,144
No details?

482
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:12,144
I'm not in the mood.

483
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,978
You asked me here
to have lunch,

484
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,078
tell me you slept with Elaine,

485
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:21,444
and then say you're not
in the mood for details.

486
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:24,044
Now, you listen to me.

487
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:27,044
I want details,
and I want them right now.

488
00:18:27,078 --> 00:18:29,644
I don't have a job.
I have no place to go.

489
00:18:29,678 --> 00:18:30,878
You're not in the mood?

490
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:33,078
Well, you get in the mood!

491
00:18:35,844 --> 00:18:38,144
I was at
the unemployment office,

492
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:39,578
and I told them I was
very close

493
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:41,478
to getting a job
with Vandelay Industries.

494
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:42,978
and I gave them
your phone number.

495
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:44,878
So now,
when the phone rings,

496
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:47,311
you have to answer
"Vandelay Industries."

497
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:48,478
I'm Vandelay Industries?

498
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:49,578
Right.

499
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:50,644
What is that?

500
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:51,878
You're in latex.

501
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:52,978
Latex.

502
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:54,044
Yes.

503
00:18:54,078 --> 00:18:55,311
And what do I do with latex?

504
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:56,878
I don't know.
You manufacture it.

505
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:59,644
Right here,
in this little apartment?

506
00:18:59,678 --> 00:19:01,278
And what do I say about you?

507
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:03,811
You're considering hiring me
for your latex salesman.

508
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:05,545
I'm gonna hire you
as my latex salesman?

509
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:06,311
I'm gonna hire you
as my latex salesman?

510
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:07,478
Right.

511
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:10,078
[LAUGHS]
I don't think so.

512
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:11,278
Man, I'm tellin' you

513
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:13,978
this pizza idea
is really gonna happen.

514
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:15,578
This is the thing
where you go,

515
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:17,411
and you have to make
your own pizza?

516
00:19:17,444 --> 00:19:18,811
Yeah. We give you the dough.

517
00:19:18,844 --> 00:19:20,778
You smash it. You pound it.

518
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:22,378
You fling it
up in the air.

519
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,911
And then you get to
put your sauce,

520
00:19:23,944 --> 00:19:26,378
and you get to sprinkle
your cheese, and then...

521
00:19:26,411 --> 00:19:29,811
you slide it
into the oven!

522
00:19:29,844 --> 00:19:31,444
You know, you have to know
how to do that.

523
00:19:31,478 --> 00:19:33,378
You can't have people
shoving their arms

524
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:34,911
into a 600-degree oven.

525
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:35,545
It's all supervised.

526
00:19:35,545 --> 00:19:36,611
It's all supervised.

527
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:38,078
Oh, well.

528
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,744
Tolstoy used to write
in the village square.

529
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:42,444
The faces inspired him.

530
00:19:42,478 --> 00:19:45,811
Although, one wonders
if <i>War and Peace</i>

531
00:19:45,844 --> 00:19:47,644
would have been as highly
acclaimed as it was

532
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:50,244
had it been published
under it's original title,

533
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:52,944
<i>War: What Is It Good For?</i>

534
00:19:52,978 --> 00:19:54,044
What?

535
00:19:54,078 --> 00:19:55,711
Yeah, Mr. Lippman.

00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:03,568
Well...

1068
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,835
the counter, ahem,
was right there.

1069
00:40:05,868 --> 00:40:09,001
I didn't know
she had a pony.

1070
00:40:09,035 --> 00:40:12,035
Who figures an immigrant's
gonna have a pony?

1071
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:15,568
I mean, in all
the pictures I saw

1072
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:19,001
of immigrants on boats
comin' into New York Harbor...

1073
00:40:19,035 --> 00:40:21,535
I never saw one of them
sittin' on a pony.

1074
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:24,115
But why would anyone
come here if they had a pony?

1075
00:40:24,115 --> 00:40:26,668
But why would anyone
come here if they had a pony?

1076
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:28,468
Who leaves a country
packed with ponies

1077
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:30,501
to come to
a non-pony country?

1078
00:40:30,535 --> 00:40:34,301
It doesn't make sense.

1079
00:40:34,335 --> 00:40:37,268
Now we'll open
the peritoneal cavity,

1080
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:41,568
exposing the body's
internal organs.

1081
00:40:41,601 --> 00:40:43,268
What are you eating?

1082
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:45,501
Junior Mints.

1083
00:40:45,535 --> 00:40:47,501
You want one?
No.

1084
00:40:47,535 --> 00:40:49,635
I can't see.

1085
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:51,701
Psst!

1086
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:54,115
Psst!

1087
00:40:54,115 --> 00:40:54,601
Psst!

1088
00:40:54,635 --> 00:40:56,535
Could you get...?

1089
00:41:01,701 --> 00:41:03,168
Where'd you get those?

1090
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:04,568
In the machine.
Do you want one?

1091
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:05,768
No.
Here.

1092
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:06,901
Take one.
I don't want one.

1093
00:41:06,935 --> 00:41:08,101
No, they're good.
Take one.

1094
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,568
I don't want any.
Just take one.

1095
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:10,868
No, Kramer.
Stop it.

1096
00:41:15,301 --> 00:41:16,335
[SPLAT]

1097
00:41:16,368 --> 00:41:19,001
It's a Junior Mint.

1098
00:41:19,035 --> 00:41:20,335
Drake's Coffee Cake.

1099
00:41:20,368 --> 00:41:21,968
Snapple?
No, thanks.

1100
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:23,835
Snapple?
No, thanks.

1101
00:41:23,868 --> 00:41:24,115
PEZ?
Uh, no.

1102
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,101
PEZ?
Uh, no.

1103
00:41:25,135 --> 00:41:26,335
Do you have a box
of Jujyfruits?

1104
00:41:26,368 --> 00:41:27,435
Clark Bar.

1105
00:41:27,468 --> 00:41:28,501
I love Yoo-hoo.

1106
00:41:28,535 --> 00:41:29,635
Ooh, Chunkys.

1107
00:41:29,668 --> 00:41:30,835
Chocolate babka.

1108
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:31,901
It's Gore-Tex.

1109
00:41:31,935 --> 00:41:32,968
Ooh, cashmere?

1110
00:41:33,001 --> 00:41:34,301
No, Gore-Tex.

1111
00:41:34,335 --> 00:41:37,001
Who's gonna turn down
a Junior Mint?

1112
00:41:37,035 --> 00:41:38,635
It's chocolate,
it's peppermint.

1113
00:41:38,668 --> 00:41:40,335
It's delicious!
That's true.

1114
00:41:40,368 --> 00:41:43,135
It's very refreshing!

1115
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,468
What's goin' on
over here?

1116
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:46,168
There's a beached whale.
She's dying.

1117
00:41:46,201 --> 00:41:49,201
MAN:
Is anyone here a marine biologist?

1118
00:41:54,368 --> 00:41:56,935
GEORGE:
<i>The sea was angry that day,</i> <i>my friends.</i>

1119
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:03,201
Like an old man trying to
send back soup in a deli.

1120
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:12,268
I got about 50 feet out,
when suddenly...

1121
00:42:12,301 --> 00:42:15,335
the great beast appeared
before me.

1122
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:19,168
I tell you, he was 10 stories
high if he was a foot.

1123
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:22,501
As if sensing my presence,
he let out a great bellow.

1124
00:42:22,535 --> 00:42:24,115
I said, "Easy, big fella."

1125
00:42:24,115 --> 00:42:24,868
I said, "Easy, big fella."

1126
00:42:26,635 --> 00:42:29,901
And then... as I watched him
struggling, I realized

1127
00:42:29,935 --> 00:42:32,135
that something was
obstructing its breathing.

1128
00:42:32,168 --> 00:42:33,468
From where I was standing,

1129
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:35,668
I could see directly into
the eye of the great fish.

1130
00:42:35,701 --> 00:42:37,268
Mammal.
Whatever.

1131
00:42:38,968 --> 00:42:40,335
Well, what did
you do next?

1132
00:42:40,368 --> 00:42:42,001
Well, then,
from out of nowhere,

1133
00:42:42,035 --> 00:42:43,801
a huge tidal wave lifted me,

1134
00:42:43,835 --> 00:42:45,235
tossed me like a cork,

1135
00:42:45,268 --> 00:42:47,001
and I found myself
right on top of him,

1136
00:42:47,035 --> 00:42:48,968
face-to-face
with the blowhole!

1137
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:51,435
I-- I could barely see
from the waves

1138
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:52,835
crashing down upon me,

1139
00:42:52,868 --> 00:42:54,115
but I knew
something was there.

1140
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:55,801
but I knew
something was there.

1141
00:42:55,835 --> 00:42:58,435
So I reached my hand in,
felt around,

1142
00:42:58,468 --> 00:43:01,435
and pulled out
the obstruction!

1143
00:43:21,535 --> 00:43:23,101
What is that,
a Titleist?

1144
00:43:27,001 --> 00:43:29,201
A hole in one, huh?

1145
00:43:30,201 --> 00:43:31,501
So we go in to NBC.

1146
00:43:31,535 --> 00:43:33,668
We tell 'em we got an idea
for a show about nothing.

1147
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:34,735
Exactly.
They say,

1148
00:43:34,768 --> 00:43:35,935
"What's your show about?"

1149
00:43:35,968 --> 00:43:37,801
I say, "nothing."
There you go.

1150
00:43:37,835 --> 00:43:40,368
I think you may have
something here.

1151
00:43:50,268 --> 00:43:52,368
[ENGINE SPUTTERING]

1152
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:00,535
[ENGINE SPUTTERING]

1153
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:16,113
Look, why don't you two just
go to the movies by yourself?

1154
00:44:16,146 --> 00:44:17,479
I'm not in the mood.

1155
00:44:17,513 --> 00:44:19,613
Well, me either.
I'm goin' to Sky Burger.

1156
00:44:19,646 --> 00:44:21,546
So you're not goin'?

1157
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:22,813
You don't need us.

1158
00:44:22,846 --> 00:44:25,479
Well, I can't go
to a bad movie by myself.

1159
00:44:25,513 --> 00:44:29,446
What, am I gonna make
sarcastic remarks to strangers?

1160
00:44:29,479 --> 00:44:31,813
Oh, I guess
I'll just go to my uncle's.

1161
00:44:31,846 --> 00:44:33,313
Should we tell him
we're leaving?

1162
00:44:33,346 --> 00:44:35,643
What for?
Let's just get outta here.

1163
00:44:35,643 --> 00:44:35,979
What for?
Let's just get outta here.

1164
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,513
Seinfeld, four!
