528
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:32,028
We, uh...

529
00:20:32,062 --> 00:20:33,362
broke up again.

530
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:34,962
Aww.
Aww.

531
00:20:34,995 --> 00:20:36,628
Too bad.

532
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:40,795
I thought
she was the one.

533
00:20:40,828 --> 00:20:41,895
I'll bring back the pot.

534
00:20:43,995 --> 00:20:45,195
Okay, come on.
It's movie time.

535
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:46,628
No.
Hey, what are you gonna see?

536
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,862
<i>Prognosis</i>
<i>Negative.</i>

537
00:20:47,895 --> 00:20:49,028
Hey, that's supposed
to be great.

538
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:50,028
It's not.

539
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:51,028
Well, how do
you know?

540
00:20:51,062 --> 00:20:53,028
I have an instinct
for these things.

541
00:20:53,062 --> 00:20:54,862
I had a parakeet
when I was a kid.

542
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:57,195
That was the only pet
that I really enjoyed.

543
00:20:57,228 --> 00:20:59,028
We used to let him
out of his cage,

544
00:20:59,062 --> 00:21:01,795
and he would fly around.
And my mother had built

545
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:05,295
one entire wall of
our living room was mirrored,

546
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:07,528
she felt this gives you
a feeling of space.

547
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:10,028
Have you ever heard this
interior-design principle?

548
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:12,172
The mirror makes it seem like
you have entire other room.

549
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:12,195
The mirror makes it seem like
you have entire other room.

550
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:14,462
What kid of jerk walks up
to a mirror and goes,

551
00:21:14,495 --> 00:21:16,195
"Hey, look. There's a whole
other room in there"?

552
00:21:16,228 --> 00:21:17,962
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

553
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:20,628
"There's a guy in there,
looks just like me."

554
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:22,962
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

555
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:24,362
But the parakeet
will fall for this.

556
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:26,362
You let him out of his cage.
He flies around.

557
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:28,795
Bang! With his little head.
He would just go:

558
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:29,962
[CLICKS]
"Oh!"

559
00:21:29,995 --> 00:21:31,195
And I'd always think,

560
00:21:31,228 --> 00:21:33,528
even if he thinks
the mirror is another room,

561
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:34,962
why doesn't he at least

562
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:37,128
try and avoid hitting
the other parakeet?

563
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,228
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
