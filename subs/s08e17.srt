1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,033
You know at the movies
they show

2
00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:07,800
that little ad
for the concession stand?

3
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:09,366
Where the cartoon
candy's dancing,

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,166
and the Milk Dud's
playing the banjo?

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,066
Oh, he's wailing
on that banjo. Yeah.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,300
I just don't understand
the Raisinets.

7
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,233
The sax player?
Yeah.

8
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:20,166
Yeah.
The box of Raisinets runs up to the concession stand,

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,500
buys another box
of Raisinets.

10
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:24,033
So?

11
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:27,466
Box of Raisinets eating
another box of Raisinets?

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,800
It's perverse.

13
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,000
No. He's not gonna
eat them.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,800
No. He's not gonna
eat them.

15
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,633
He's buying them for
his Pepsi girlfriend.

16
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,466
And why is
he dating a Pepsi?

17
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,733
They're not having
children.

18
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:37,933
They're
musicians.

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,333
Musicians.

20
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:42,000
Get a real job.

21
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:49,533
What do you want?

22
00:00:49,566 --> 00:00:51,133
Oh, I've had everything
on the menu.

23
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,133
Uh...

24
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:53,166
surprise me.

25
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,833
Neil. Neil.

26
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,066
Oh. I am sorry.

27
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,800
I am supposed to
meet my boyfriend here.

28
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,500
He looks
just like you.

29
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,000
Really.

30
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,366
Yeah.

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,966
Like me?
Uh-huh. Sorry.

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,933
He-he.

33
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:13,835
Like me?

34
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:14,633
Like me?

35
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,166
But how?

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,666
Here's your halibut
omelet.

37
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,866
Surprised?

38
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,866
Yes. Yes, I am.

39
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,133
KRAMER:
Look what I got for you for your Florida trip.

40
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,700
Crazy Shirts was
closing them out.

41
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:30,333
I got a dozen
for a buck.

42
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:33,866
I saved a fortune.
Look at that.

43
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,900
There
you go.

44
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:36,366
Oh.

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,033
"Number-one dad."
[CHUCKLES] Yeah.

46
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:40,266
Ooh, and it's a medium. Perfect.

47
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,666
KRAMER:
Hey. Hey.

48
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,666
You ready?

49
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:43,835
Almost.
Okay, so look, uh,

50
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:45,166
Almost.
Okay, so look, uh,

51
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,856
when you're in Florida,
can my cigar guy

52
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,856
drop off some Cubans
for me at your parents'?

53
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,123
I'm helping my parents
move into their new condo.

54
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:52,190
I'm gonna be busy.

55
00:01:52,223 --> 00:01:54,956
Oh, come on, man.
Help a brother out.

56
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,190
All right.

57
00:01:56,223 --> 00:01:58,490
Yeah.
I owe you one.

58
00:01:58,523 --> 00:02:00,090
We're even.

59
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:03,290
Hey, Jerry...
figure this out.

60
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,956
I'm in the coffee shop,

61
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,023
and this beautiful girl
I could never even talk to

62
00:02:08,056 --> 00:02:10,190
mistakes me
for her boyfriend.

63
00:02:10,223 --> 00:02:11,823
That's a nice four seconds.

64
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:13,835
I look just like him.

65
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:14,123
I look just like him.

66
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:16,790
I, me...this.

67
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:18,456
This is what
her boyfriend looks like.

68
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,556
How is that possible?

69
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,556
Maybe he has money.

70
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,890
Maybe he doesn't.

71
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:23,856
Maybe he and I
are exactly the same,

72
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,690
except for one minor,
yet crucial, detail.

73
00:02:26,723 --> 00:02:27,823
You never know.

74
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,256
Sometimes you do.

75
00:02:31,023 --> 00:02:34,190
Maybe it's some--
Some small thing I could change.

76
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:35,790
Like a mustache
or, uh...

77
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:36,790
wearing a top hat.

78
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,790
Or a monocle.

79
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:39,323
Or a-- Or a cane.

80
00:02:39,356 --> 00:02:40,923
Who's she dating?
Mr. Peanut?

81
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:47,690
You could do a lot worse
than Mr. Peanut, my friend.

82
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:52,156
So, what do
you wanna see?

83
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,490
How about
<i>Sack Lunch?</i>

84
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:55,956
How about
<i>The English Patient?</i>

85
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,290
It's up for
all those Oscars.

86
00:02:57,323 --> 00:02:58,623
Oh, Come on, Blaine.
I mean,

87
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:00,456
look at the poster
for <i>Sack Lunch.</i>

88
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,456
It's a family
in a brown paper bag.

89
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,023
Don't you wanna know
how they got in there?

90
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:07,256
[CHUCKLES]
No.

91
00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:10,656
Oh.
Sold out.

92
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,323
Oh. Uh, two for
<i>The English Patient.</i>

93
00:03:13,356 --> 00:03:13,835
So do you think
they got shrunk down,

94
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:14,890
So do you think
they got shrunk down,

95
00:03:14,923 --> 00:03:17,156
or is it just
a giant sack?

96
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:24,056
Uh, hi.
Um, remember me?

97
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,123
I-I-- I'm the guy
that looks like Neil.

98
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:27,123
Hi.
Hi.

99
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:29,290
Ahem.

100
00:03:29,323 --> 00:03:31,123
Is Neil here?

101
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:32,556
Oh, no. He got
held up at work.

102
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,056
Oh, that's too bad.

103
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,623
I-- I kinda wanted to meet him,
seeing as we look so similar.

104
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:39,290
Huh. Well, you know, you don't
look that much like him.

105
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:40,656
Oh.

106
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,623
Of course not.

107
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:43,835
No, you're
a little taller.

108
00:03:43,835 --> 00:03:45,056
No, you're
a little taller.

109
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,056
You look like you're
in better shape than Neil.

110
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,090
Do you work out?

111
00:03:53,923 --> 00:03:55,323
Listen, I--
I'm--

112
00:03:55,356 --> 00:03:56,956
I-I don't mean
to seem forward,

113
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,056
but is-- Is there any way
that I could possibly

114
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,490
have Neil's phone number?

115
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:06,390
What is everyone
talking about?

116
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:09,356
<i>"The English Patient,</i>
it's so romantic"?

117
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,290
God, that movie
stunk.

118
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:13,690
I kinda liked it.

119
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:13,835
No, you didn't.

120
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:15,456
No, you didn't.

121
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,490
Elaine, Blaine.

122
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:19,323
Did you just see
<i>The English Patient?</i>

123
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:21,023
Didn't you
love it?

124
00:04:21,056 --> 00:04:22,123
No.

125
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:24,056
How could you not
love that movie?

126
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,423
How about, it sucked.

127
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:29,956
That Ralph Fiennes.

128
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,623
I would give up
my firstborn for him.

129
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:36,023
Uh. He's getting
the short end of that stick.

130
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:41,356
Jerry, this is
Del Boca Vista's

131

new physical
fitness room.

132
00:04:42,923 --> 00:04:43,835
They got
medicine balls.

133
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:44,056
They got
medicine balls.

134
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,990
You can bike ride.
Anything you want.

135
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:47,156

What?

136
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,090
Nothing.

137
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,056
See what I'm wearing?

138
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,823
Oh. Did you get that
out of my bag?

139
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:53,990
No. Your mother found it.

140
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:56,490
Son...this is
the most wonderful

141
00:04:56,523 --> 00:04:58,956
and thoughtful thing
you've ever done for me.

142
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,123
You know, I bought you
a Cadillac.

143
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:02,056
Twice.

144
00:05:04,823 --> 00:05:06,156
Oh. Here he is.

145
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,856
This is the man
I wanted you to see.

146
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,390
Izzy Mandelbaum.
IZZY: Hey there.

147
00:05:09,423 --> 00:05:12,323
He's 80 years old,
but strong as an ox.

148
00:05:12,356 --> 00:05:13,256
Watch this.

149

[EXHALES]

150
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:18,123
See that?
You couldn't do that.

151
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:19,723
I could.
I choose not to.

152
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,023
Hey, Morty.
Who's this?

153
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:26,323
This is my son, Jerry,
from New York.

154
00:05:26,356 --> 00:05:27,890
He thinks he can lift
more than Izzy.

155
00:05:27,923 --> 00:05:29,356
I-I didn't
say that.

156
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,556
Hey, Izzy.

157
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,723
This kid says he can
lift more than you can.

158
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,390
Hey, your kid's
pretty funny, Morty.

159
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:37,856
He should be a comedian.

160
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,456
Actually, I am
a comedian.

161
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,023
That's not so funny.

162
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:43,835
You think you're better
than me, huh?

163
00:05:43,835 --> 00:05:44,190
You think you're better
than me, huh?

164
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:47,623
Izzy used to work out
with Charles Atlas in the '50s.

165

166
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:50,490
Well, that's it.

167
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:52,356
It's go time.

168
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,690
Let's see you lift that.

169
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:55,323
Mr. Mandelbaum--
Come on, come on.

170
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:56,390
Pump it.

171
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,690
All right.

172
00:05:57,723 --> 00:05:59,056
Eh. Wrong
attitude.

173
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,523
You're not bringing
that trash

174
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:01,690
into
my house.

175
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,056
There. All right?

176

Step aside,

I'll show you.

00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,056
I'm gonna take it up
a notch.
