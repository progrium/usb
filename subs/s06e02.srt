00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,549
It must be a mistake.

359
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,883
No, it isn't.

360
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,683
And the most distressing
part about it is,

361
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,116
not that she went out
with him,

362
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:34,549
but that <i>he</i> stopped
seeing <i>her.</i>

363
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,949
Do you understand?

364
00:12:36,983 --> 00:12:37,949
He, Newman.

365
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:41,183
Newman stopped seeing her.

366
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:42,883
Newman never stops
seeing anybody.

367
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,516
Newman will see whoever
is willing to see him.

368
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:47,183
So the question then is
not so much

369
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:49,016
why did she see him--

370
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:49,405
as disturbing as that is--

371
00:12:49,405 --> 00:12:52,116
as disturbing as that is--

372
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:56,683
but why did he, Newman,
stop seeing her?

373
00:12:56,716 --> 00:13:01,683
Perhaps there's more
to Newman than meets the eye.

374
00:13:01,716 --> 00:13:04,149
No. There's less.

375
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,416
It's possible.

376
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:09,849
No. It isn't.

377
00:13:09,883 --> 00:13:11,416
I've looked into his eyes.

378
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:13,383
He's pure evil.

379
00:13:14,783 --> 00:13:18,116
Maybe he's an enigma.
A mystery wrapped in a riddle.

380
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:19,405
Yeah, he's a mystery
wrapped in a Twinkie.

381
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:20,316
Yeah, he's a mystery
wrapped in a Twinkie.

382
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,716
Can I get you
some more coffee?

383
00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:24,716
No. But thank you.

384
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:26,916
Oh, by the way,
your stationery store guy called.

385
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:27,883
He's got your pencil.

386
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,349
Oh. You are kidding me.

387
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:32,583
No, he left
the store early,

388
00:13:32,616 --> 00:13:34,716
made a special trip to
the distributor and got it.

389
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:37,183
I bought one yesterday
on 14th Street.

390
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,849
What did you do that for?
He already ordered it.

391
00:13:39,883 --> 00:13:41,249
I wanted to please
Mr. Pitt.

392
00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:43,349
Well, you better
go down there and tell this guy.

393
00:13:43,383 --> 00:13:44,449
He's very excited.

394
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:46,449
Oh, boy.

395
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:47,916
Oh, hi, Julie.
Hi.

396
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:48,916
Hi, Julie.

397
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:49,405
Hi. How are you,
Elaine?

398
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:50,049
Hi. How are you,
Elaine?

399
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,549
I'm meeting
George here.

400
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,949
Oh...well then,
I better get going.

401
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:56,049
Otherwise George will
make me buy him lunch

402
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,583
to make up for that big salad
he bought me yesterday.

403
00:13:58,616 --> 00:14:00,783
How do you know that?

404
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:03,916
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

405
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:05,516
NEWMAN:
Who is it?

406
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:07,283
It's Jerry.

407
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:08,749
Well, it's kind of
a bad time now.

408
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:09,916
Could you come back later?

409
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,549
Come on, Newman,
open the door!

410
00:14:16,883 --> 00:14:17,883
Hello, Jerry.

411
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:22,083
What a rare treat.

412
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:23,749
What brings you down
to the east wing?

413
00:14:23,783 --> 00:14:25,516
Okay, pudgy, let's stop
playing games.

414
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:27,016
Now, what happened
with Margaret?

415
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:28,183
No need to
get excited.

416
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:29,849
Can't we discuss this
like gentlemen?

417
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:30,849
No, we can't.

418
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:32,216
My skin is crawling

419
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:34,649
just being inside
your little rat's nest.

420
00:14:35,816 --> 00:14:37,083
Now, what happened?

421
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:38,916
All right, you wanna
know what happened?

422
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:40,449
I'll tell you
what happened.

423
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:43,716
She wasn't my type.

424
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,416
Not your type?

425
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:47,083
Not really.

426
00:14:47,116 --> 00:14:48,583
Well, how come?

427
00:14:48,616 --> 00:14:49,405
Oh, she just didn't
do it for me.

428
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:51,216
Oh, she just didn't
do it for me.

429
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:52,916
But what is wrong with her?

430
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:54,549
[LAUGHS]
Well...

431
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:58,549
if you're happy with her...
that's all that matters.

432
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,883
You don't think
she's attractive?

433
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,849
No.

434
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:05,616
I need a really pretty face.

435
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:08,783
But, hey...that's me.

436
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:11,749
Okay, Newman,
thanks a lot.

437
00:15:11,783 --> 00:15:12,916
Care for some lemonade?

438
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:14,049
No, thank you.

439
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,083
Drop by any time...Jerry.

440
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,083
[LAUGHS]

441
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,583
Jerry. All right.
Now, listen to this.

442
00:15:23,616 --> 00:15:25,949
"If a player cleans his ball

443
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:27,783
"during play of a hole,

444
00:15:27,816 --> 00:15:29,716
"except on the putting green,

445
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:32,116
he shall incur a penalty
of one stroke."

446
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:33,183
That's the rule, Jerry.

447
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:34,616
But, it's just
a friendly game.

448
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:36,683
Why do you always have to be
such a stickler?

449
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:38,583
Because that's the way
I was raised.

450
00:15:38,616 --> 00:15:39,949
You know, when I
was growing up,

451
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:41,916
I had to be in bed
every night by 9:00.

452
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,183
And if I wasn't...

453
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:45,383
Well, I don't have to
tell you what happened.

454
00:15:46,716 --> 00:15:49,405
What are you so worried
about this for?

455
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:50,349
What are you so worried
about this for?

456
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,916
You know, he talked
about Pinkus on the course?

457
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:54,283
He did?
Oh, yeah.

458
00:15:54,316 --> 00:15:56,449
He said he brought a pair
of pants into Pinkus',

459
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:57,949
and they came back
stained

460
00:15:57,983 --> 00:16:00,349
with some kind of
dry-cleaning fluid.

461
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:02,549
And Pinkus denied
responsibility.

462
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,716
You see, he was very
upset with Pinkus.

463
00:16:04,749 --> 00:16:06,549
So it had nothing
to do with you.

464
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,183
Yeah, but maybe
I pushed him over the edge.

465
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:10,283
No, I don't think so.

466
00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:12,383
Poor Pinkus.

467
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,283
Poor little Pinkus.

468
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:18,449
Hey, let me ask
you a question.

469
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:19,405
You met Margaret.

470
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:20,383
You met Margaret.

471
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,016
You think Margaret's
good-looking?

472
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,683
Oh. She's a natural beauty.

473
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,716
No makeup.
Ooh, I like that.

474
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:27,083
Yeah.

475
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:28,549
And the curls?
You like the curls?

476
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,416
Oh, I love curls.

477
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:31,616
Yeah, me too.

478
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:32,916
All right, I'll see
you later.

479
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:33,916
Where you going?

480
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:34,949
Gendason's.

481
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:36,283
You're going
to see Gendason?

482
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:37,983
It's weighing
on my conscience.

483
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:43,283
You know...I think I could
have played with dolls,

484
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:45,249
if there were dolls
in the house.

485
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:47,283
That seems like
fun to me.

486
00:16:47,316 --> 00:16:48,949
It doesn't seem like
a gender thing.

487
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:49,405
I think I would like
to play with dolls.

488
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:51,449
I think I would like
to play with dolls.

489
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:53,849
What's so terrible?

490
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:56,383
So, George, I was talking
to Elaine before--

491
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,383
Uh, uh. We're
just friends. [LAUGHS]

492
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,016
Yes, well, anyway,

493
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:03,283
she said something
that was kind of intriguing.

494
00:17:03,316 --> 00:17:05,016
Oh. Share.

495
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:07,916
Well...when I came
over to the table,

496
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:09,549
she mentioned
something about

497
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,116
how she had better
hurry up and leave,

498
00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:13,049
or you would make
her buy lunch,

499
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,083
to make up for the one
that you bought yesterday.

500
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,949
[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY]

501
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:18,849
I'm not following.

502
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:19,405
Well, my question is,
how could Elaine be

503
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,916
Well, my question is,
how could Elaine be

504
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:25,416
under the impression that
you bought the big salad,

505
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:28,183
when I was the one
that handed it to her?

506
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:31,749
Well, she probably
just assumed.

507
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:33,816
Hmm.
Did she?

508
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:36,783
[LAUGHS
UNCOMFORTABLY]

509
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:38,749
Wait--
Wait a second.

510
00:17:38,783 --> 00:17:42,449
Are you suggesting that
I went out of my way

511
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:46,949
to tell Elaine that,
even though you handed her the big salad,

512
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,249
that it came from me.

513
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:49,405
That's what I'm suggesting.

514
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:49,749
That's what I'm suggesting.

515
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:53,283
Well, it was a big salad.

516
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,616
And what I would like
to know is,

517
00:17:56,649 --> 00:18:00,249
how does a person who has
virtually nothing to do

518
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:02,716
with the big salad,
claim responsibility

519
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,049
for that salad,

520
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,849
and accept that thank-you
under false pretenses, huh?

521
00:18:06,883 --> 00:18:08,583
Huh? Huh?

522
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:12,949
George, all I did
was hand someone a bag.

523
00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:19,405
It's just that my boss
is very demanding,

524
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:22,016
It's just that my boss
is very demanding,

525
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:24,083
and he needed the pencil
right away.

526
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:26,449
Well, why did you tell me
to order it

527
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:29,549
if you knew you were going to
get one someplace else?

528
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,183
No, no. No.
I didn't know.

529
00:18:31,216 --> 00:18:32,349
I'm--
I'm sorry.

530
00:18:32,383 --> 00:18:34,516
I went all the way down
to the warehouse.

531
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:36,716
