The transplant, the hair plug,

It's really quite amazing.

on your shower soap yesterday,

the first transplant?

take a shower,

rush it in there by helicopter,

00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:18,333
you know, keep the soap alive
on the soap-support system.

move it over?

but sometimes the toe
next to the big toe gets so big

that there's, like,
a power struggle

44
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:31,110
and the second toe assumes
control of the foot.

536
00:19:03,973 --> 00:19:04,576
All right,
you really want to know?

537
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,310
It all started
when she told me that...

538
00:19:08,343 --> 00:19:10,543
She was the voice
on your tape recorder.

539
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,176
What, Elaine?
Yeah.

540
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,776
She made me promise
not to tell you.

541
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,176
It was supposed
to be a joke.

542
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,243
That was Elaine?

543
00:19:17,276 --> 00:19:18,310
Yeah, yeah. Let me hear.

544
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:19,910
Wait a second.
Just give me a second.

545
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:21,743
You heard it 50 times already.
No, I haven't.

546
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:24,410
This is my ex-girlfriend.
I think I have precedence.

547
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:25,743
Ohhh...

[INTERCOM BUZZES]

549
00:19:30,176 --> 00:19:31,343
Yeah?

550
00:19:31,376 --> 00:19:33,973
<i>Hi, it's Elaine.</i>
<i>Is this a bad time?</i>

551
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:34,810
<i>Hi, it's Elaine.</i>
<i>Is this a bad time?</i>

552
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:36,810
Yeah.

553
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,243
Don't tell her
I told you anything!

554
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:40,876
She'll kill me!
Okay, I promise!

555
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:47,110
Wow.

556
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:51,676
Oh, man.

557
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,243
Oh, God.

558
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,776
Oh, brother.

559
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,010
Ohhh! Wow!

560
00:19:59,043 --> 00:20:00,076
What's the matter?
Oh--

561
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,510
I... got a pain in my side...

562
00:20:03,543 --> 00:20:03,973
From, you know...

563

From, you know...

564
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,076
Oh, hi, George.

565
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,043
How you doing?

566
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,543
Something stinks in here.

567
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:15,143
Oh.

568
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,843
What are you doing here?

569
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:21,743
I was the one who talked
into your tape recorder.

570
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:23,543
I know,
George told me.

571
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:29,143
You told him?

572
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:30,543
H-h-h-he threatened me.

573
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:33,973
Where did you come up
with all that stuff?

574
00:20:33,973 --> 00:20:35,010
Where did you come up
with all that stuff?

575
00:20:35,043 --> 00:20:36,176
Oh, that was nothing.

576
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,143
Elaine...

577
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,343
I-- I have to
tell you something.

578
00:20:40,376 --> 00:20:41,776
George, no.
No, no, no.

579
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,776
George, I'm telling you.

580
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,710
What is it?

581
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,676
I'm very attracted
to you.

582
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,076
Oyyyy...

583
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,210
I found a hair!

584
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:50,776
Yes!

585
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,776
Okay, come here,
come here.

586
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,276
Take a look
at this.

587
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,076
Ever since I found out
that you left the message

588
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,343
on Jerry's tape recorder,
I--

589
00:20:57,376 --> 00:20:58,643
Whoa.

590
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,743
That was you?

591
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:03,843
It was a joke.

592
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:03,973
Wait...

593
00:21:03,973 --> 00:21:06,676
Wait...

594
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,310
Oh, my God.

595
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:10,976
Oh, yeah.

596
00:21:13,043 --> 00:21:16,110
Elaine, I can't believe
that that is you.

597
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:17,143
I--

598
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,176
I think I'll get going.

599
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,010
Er, stick around
a while.

600
00:21:27,043 --> 00:21:28,010
It's early.

601
00:21:28,043 --> 00:21:30,543
We'll order
Chinese.

602
00:21:33,343 --> 00:21:33,973
All right,
give me the tape!

603
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:34,576
All right,
give me the tape!

604
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,176
I had it first! It was my tape!
Give me the tape!

606
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:46,705
A woman left me a message on
my phone machine the other day

607
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,605
with kind of a breathy voice,
you know.

608
00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:49,905
No matter what a woman says,

609
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:52,305
if it's in that breathy voice,
you know, it...

610
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:53,371
[BREATHY VOICE]
"You have cancer."

611
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:54,471

613
00:21:56,971 --> 00:21:58,405
Sounds pretty good.

00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:01,538
The stewardess could lean over

616
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:02,805
and whisper in my ear,

617
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:04,638
[BREATHY VOICE]
"Would you put on
your seat belt?

618
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:07,805
"We're about to go
into a mountain."

619
00:22:07,838 --> 00:22:10,105
I would go, "Really?
So, what are you doing later

620
00:22:10,138 --> 00:22:13,511
"by the ruptured remains
of the fuselage?

621
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:13,738
"by the ruptured remains
of the fuselage?

622
00:22:13,771 --> 00:22:17,105
"How about some peanuts
over by the black box?

00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:18,405
Look, I'll meet you there."
