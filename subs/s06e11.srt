1
00:00:01,694 --> 00:00:03,094
Tennis is the only sport

2
00:00:03,127 --> 00:00:04,894
where the uniform
is what you would wear

3
00:00:04,927 --> 00:00:07,494
under your clothes
in any other sport.

4
00:00:07,527 --> 00:00:09,427
You're actually out there
in your underwear.

5
00:00:09,461 --> 00:00:11,527
Unless in the old days,
you know, they would wear

6
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:13,894
those long pants
and the big heavy sweaters.

7
00:00:13,927 --> 00:00:16,027
How long did it take them
to get over that?

8
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:18,494
We're out here in the hot sun,
running around after a ball.

9
00:00:18,527 --> 00:00:21,694
What exactly are we
all dressed up for?

10
00:00:21,727 --> 00:00:23,994
Maybe that's why they started
keeping score like that.

11
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:24,994
Point?
You know what?

12
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:26,761
Make it 15.

13
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,694
I'm dying in this sweater here.

14
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:29,761
Oh, another one got by me?

15
00:00:29,794 --> 00:00:30,000
Take another 10 points.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,427
Take another 10 points.

17
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:33,194
Let's just get this over with.

18
00:00:38,294 --> 00:00:40,061
JERRY:
Come on, let's go.

19
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:41,261
No, wait.
I gotta go in here.

20
00:00:41,294 --> 00:00:42,727
I gotta pick up
Mr. Pitts' racket.

21
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:43,727
What's it doing here?

22
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:45,027
He wanted to
have it restrung.

23
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:46,261
Here, I need
to pick that up.

24
00:00:46,294 --> 00:00:47,294
Hello.

25
00:00:48,794 --> 00:00:49,761
Oh, hi.

26
00:00:49,794 --> 00:00:51,161
Jocelyn Landis
from Doubleday.

27
00:00:51,194 --> 00:00:52,161
Yes.

28
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:53,561
I interviewed you
for a position

29
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:54,827
a couple of months ago.

30
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:56,794
Yes, yes.
The one I didn't get.

31
00:00:57,461 --> 00:00:59,261
I was watching you play.

32
00:00:59,294 --> 00:01:01,161
Oh, I'm not very good.

33
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,761
No, you exhibited
a lot of grace out there.

34
00:01:04,794 --> 00:01:04,910
Really? Grace?
Yes.

35
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,894
Really? Grace?
Yes.

36
00:01:06,927 --> 00:01:09,094
So have you
found anything yet?

37
00:01:09,127 --> 00:01:12,261
Uh, no.
Not really.

38
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:14,227
You know, you should
keep in touch.

39
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:16,427
Something may be opening up
in a few weeks.

40
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:17,427
Oh.

41
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:19,761
Is that
a Bruline?

42
00:01:19,794 --> 00:01:20,894
Oh,
Bruline.

43
00:01:20,927 --> 00:01:22,561
Hey, Newman's got
the same one.

44
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:24,227
Newman
plays tennis?

45
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:25,694
He's fantastic.

46
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:27,894
Would you mind
if I tried this out?

47
00:01:28,927 --> 00:01:30,561
Uh, no.

48
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:31,594
Take it.

49
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:33,394
How will you
get it back?

50
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,910
Um, well, I could
come by your office

51
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,261
Um, well, I could
come by your office

52
00:01:35,294 --> 00:01:36,661
and pick it up
tomorrow.

53
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:38,394
That's so generous
of you.

54
00:01:38,427 --> 00:01:40,261
Well...
Thanks.

55
00:01:41,594 --> 00:01:43,161
You loaned her
Pitts's racket?

56
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:44,161
What could I do?

57
00:01:44,194 --> 00:01:45,161
She said
there might be

58
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:46,527
something for me
at Doubleday.

59
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:47,861
Oh, wouldn't that
be great?

60
00:01:47,894 --> 00:01:49,861
I wouldn't have to work
for Mr. Pitt anymore.

61
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:51,727
I gotta
get going.

62
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:53,727
Oh, okay. Next time
let's play ping-pong.

63
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:55,361
It's easier
to jump over the net.

64
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:57,194
Yeah.

65
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:58,427
Bye.
Bye-bye.

66
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:03,961
Have you noticed
that she never laughs?

67
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:04,910
Hm, really?

68
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,994
Hm, really?

69
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:07,894
Yeah.
Think about it.

70
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:11,494
You're not gonna
believe this.

71
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:12,494
Yeah,
let me see.

72
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:13,961
There she is.
Check that out.

73
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:17,027
Whoa.

74
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:18,227
You're dating
this woman?

75
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,194
That's right.

76
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:21,361
Well, George,

77
00:02:21,394 --> 00:02:23,227
you're becoming
one of the glitterati.

78
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:24,361
What's that?

79
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,227
You know,
people who glitter.

80
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:29,194
This is a slim gal.
Yeah.

81
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:30,327
And the amazing
thing is,

82
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:31,827
she eats like
there's no tomorrow.

83
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,027
I mean,
I've never seen

84
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:34,910
an appetite like this.
Desserts, everything.

85
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,061
an appetite like this.
Desserts, everything.

86
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:36,261
I don't know how
she does it.

87
00:02:36,294 --> 00:02:38,161
Maybe she's bulimic.

88
00:02:38,194 --> 00:02:39,161
What?

89
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:40,294
Bulimic, you know.

90
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:43,261
Kramer,
she's a model.

91
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:44,261
Exactly.

92
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:46,661
Well, I have noticed
she does tend

93
00:02:46,694 --> 00:02:48,827
to go to the bathroom
right after we finish eating.

94
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:50,061
Yeah?

95
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:51,461
There you go,
monkey boy.

96
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:53,294
Come on.

97
00:02:58,194 --> 00:02:59,394
Mm, mm.

98
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:00,827
Oh, oh, so good.

99
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:02,927
Mm.

100
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,894
Aren't you hungry?

101
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:10,294
Just enjoying
watching you.

102
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,694
So did you like
the movie?

103
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:17,061
Yeah, it was
okay.

104
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:19,227
Frankenstein didn't seem
quite right to me.

105
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:20,461
I missed
the sport jacket.

106
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:23,527
Not that it was
that nice of a jacket.

107
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,194
I mean, it didn't
fit him that well,

108
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:26,894
but to me there's just
something about

109
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:28,827
a monster
in a blazer.

110
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:30,894
I mean, shows at least
he's making an effort.

111
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:33,627
That's funny.

112
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:37,594
Well, I'm glad
you enjoyed it.

113
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:39,861
Mm.

114
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:42,894
Oh, I'm so full.

115
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:44,927
Yes. Full.

116
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:47,694
Love to be full.
Love to just sit back,

117
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,727
loosen the old belt
and digest away for hours.

118
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:52,761
Let those enzymes
do their work.

119
00:03:52,794 --> 00:03:54,394
Will you excuse me?

120
00:03:54,427 --> 00:03:55,394
Where you goin'?

121
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:56,427
I just need to freshen up.

122
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:59,861
Uh, you're fresh.

123
00:03:59,894 --> 00:04:00,861
You're very fresh.

124
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:02,661
You seem very fresh
to me.

125
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:03,994
You're very vital.

126
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:04,910
I-I couldn't take you
any fresher.

127
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,761
I-I couldn't take you
any fresher.

128
00:04:05,794 --> 00:04:07,261
George,
I need to freshen.

129
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:08,261
George?

130
00:04:08,294 --> 00:04:09,561
George! George!

131
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:12,761
JERRY:
It was unbelievable.

132
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,094
You were right.
The jokes kept

133
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:16,327
bouncing off her
like Superman.

134
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:17,994
See, what did
I tell you?

135
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:19,594
And even when
she did like something,

136
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:23,594
she doesn't laugh.
She says, "That's funny."

137
00:04:23,627 --> 00:04:25,527
That's funny!

138
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:27,994
Oh, I gotta call
that woman at Doubleday.

139
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:30,194
See when I can pick up
Mr. Pitts's racket.

140
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:33,194
I mean, how can I be
with someone that doesn't laugh?

141
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:34,910
It's like...
Well, it's like something.

142
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,627
It's like...
Well, it's like something.

143
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:40,027
Hello?
Yeah, hi.

144
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:42,494
Uh, is Ms. Landis there,
please?

145
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:44,261
What?

146
00:04:44,294 --> 00:04:46,527
Oh, gosh.

147
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:47,527
Uh, okay.

148
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:49,194
She'll be in later?

149
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:50,927
Okay, thank you.

150
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:52,361
Ugh.

151
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:55,561
This guy said she hurt her arm
playing tennis.

152
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:58,561
It's pretty bad.

153
00:05:00,594 --> 00:05:03,061
Well,
I heard a noise.

154
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:04,910
What noise?

155
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,994
What noise?

156
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:07,561
You know, uh, blah.

157
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:12,294
What blah?

158
00:05:13,194 --> 00:05:15,061
From the bathroom.

159
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:17,527
Oh, you think
she was, uh, refunding?

160
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,394
Every time we go out to eat,
the minute we're done eating,

161
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:22,761
she's running for the bathroom.

162
00:05:22,794 --> 00:05:24,061
So you're concerned?

163
00:05:24,094 --> 00:05:27,094
Elaine, of course
I'm concerned.

164
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,127
I'm paying
for those meals.

165
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:32,961
It's like throwing money
down the toilet.

166
00:05:34,194 --> 00:05:34,910
In a manner of speaking.

167
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:35,261
In a manner of speaking.

168
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,261
Right.

169
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,427
I mean, digest it.

170
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,161
Let me get
my money's worth.

171
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:41,327
What would be good
is if there was someone else

172
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:43,261
in the bathroom
that could tell me.

173
00:05:43,294 --> 00:05:45,194
Hey, here's
your scrubber back, pal.

174
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:46,694
Oh, thanks.

175
00:05:46,727 --> 00:05:49,327
Hey, maybe I could, uh,
bribe one of those women

176
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:51,527
that hand out the towels
in the powder room.

177
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:52,927
A matron?
Yeah.

178
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:56,561
Uh, well, I can't
help you there.

179
00:05:58,294 --> 00:05:59,261
What?

180
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:00,394
Nothing.

00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:06,716
In fact,
I went over there.

534
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:08,382
So, what happened?

535
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,549
Did she throw you out,
huh?

536
00:20:09,582 --> 00:20:11,916
No, actually,
she took it pretty well.

537
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:14,549
So, what happened?

538
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:16,249
She's into it.

539
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:21,682
Into what?

540
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:23,549
The ménage.

541
00:20:23,582 --> 00:20:25,816
And not only that,
she just called me.

542
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,549
She told me
she spoke with the roommate,

543
00:20:27,582 --> 00:20:30,216
and the roommate's
into the ménage too.

544
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,049
That's unbelievable!

545
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:34,349
Oh, it's a scene, man.

546
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:39,182
Do you ever just get down
on your knees

547
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:43,149
and thank God that you know me
and have access to my dementia?

548
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:47,816
What are you talking about?
I'm not gonna do it.

549
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:48,982
You're not
gonna do it?

550
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:50,682
What do you mean,
you're not gonna do it?

551
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,882
I can't.
I'm not an orgy guy.

552
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,716
Are you crazy?!

553
00:20:56,749 --> 00:21:00,382
This is like discovering
plutonium by accident!

554
00:21:02,982 --> 00:21:04,149
Don't you know
what it means

555
00:21:04,182 --> 00:21:05,261
to become
an orgy guy?

556
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:05,549
to become
an orgy guy?

557
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:06,649
It changes
everything.

558
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,882
I'd have to
dress different.

559
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,049
I'd have to
act different.

560
00:21:09,082 --> 00:21:10,316
I'd have to
grow a mustache

561
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:12,616
and get all kinds of robes
and lotions and...

562
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:15,316
I'd-- I'd need
a new bedspread, new curtains.

563
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:16,716
I'd have to get
thick carpeting

564
00:21:16,749 --> 00:21:18,182
and weirdo lighting.

565
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:19,849
Of course, I'd have
to get new friends.

566
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:22,482
I'd have to get
orgy friends.

567
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:24,982
No, I'm not ready for it.

568
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,590
If only something like that
could happen to me.

569
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:33,590
Oh, shut up.

570
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:34,823
You couldn't do it
either.

571
00:21:36,057 --> 00:21:37,057
I know.

572
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:40,923
Hey, what happened?
Did you get your racket?

573
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:43,423
No. I got caught.

574
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:45,257
What do you mean,
you got caught?

575
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,090
Her assistant
caught me.

576
00:21:47,123 --> 00:21:48,790
And now I'm probably
not gonna get a job.

577
00:21:48,823 --> 00:21:50,257
He's gonna tell Landis
that I was

578
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,990
sneaking around
her office.

579
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:54,790
I still don't understand
how you can get in trouble

580
00:21:54,823 --> 00:21:56,623
for taking
your own racket.

581
00:21:56,657 --> 00:21:57,495
Meanwhile, Mr. Pitt's
got this match

582
00:21:57,495 --> 00:21:59,823
Meanwhile, Mr. Pitt's
got this match

583
00:21:59,857 --> 00:22:02,123
with Ethel Kennedy
this afternoon.

584
00:22:02,557 --> 00:22:03,523
Hey.

585
00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:04,757
Hey, Cosmo.
Hi, Cosmo.

586
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,923
Thanks, buddy.

587
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,323
Hey, doesn't Newman
have a Bruline racket?

588
00:22:08,357 --> 00:22:09,590
Uh, yeah, yeah.

589
00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:10,790
But he's
on vacation.

590
00:22:10,823 --> 00:22:11,990
Went to
Baltimore.

591
00:22:12,023 --> 00:22:14,257
Hm, but you got the key
to his place, right?

592
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,523
Yeah.

593
00:22:15,557 --> 00:22:17,690
Elaine needs to borrow
his racket, just for today.

594
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:18,990
All right, all right.

595
00:22:19,023 --> 00:22:20,690
Come on. I'll take you
over to Newman's.

596
00:22:20,723 --> 00:22:22,990
Hey, Cosmo, what happened
to your mother last night?

597
00:22:23,023 --> 00:22:24,023
She hung me
out to dry.

598
00:22:24,057 --> 00:22:25,190
KRAMER:
She quit.

599
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:26,857
Well, you know,
it would have been nice

600
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,495
if somebody
told me about it.

601
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:28,157
if somebody
told me about it.

602
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,757
I just think
she could have

603
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,023
said something,
that's all.

604
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:32,857
Well, don't talk to me,
George. Talk to her.

605
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,523
Well, where is she?
I don't know.

606
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:36,457
[WOMAN MOANING]

607
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,823
Ma!

608
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,523
Cosmo!

609
00:22:40,557 --> 00:22:41,990
We were-- We-- We--

610
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:44,157
Cosmo?
