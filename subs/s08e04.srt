Is that it?

526
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:34,719
Uh, yeah, yeah.

527
00:20:34,752 --> 00:20:35,719
Here it is, Brody.

528
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:39,919
One copy of <i>Cry, Cry Again.</i>

529
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:41,752
How'd it turn out?

530
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:43,089
Great.
Great, yeah.

531
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:43,752
Great.
Great, yeah.

532
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,252
Although the, uh, whole story

533
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,985
kind of comes apart
at the end there.

534
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:48,919
Yeah, out of nowhere
there's this lone dancer

535
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:50,085
who appears
to be injured.

536
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,152
Yeah. I-it's a disturbing image.

537
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:54,385
Yeah, so you cry,

538
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,485
and then when you see
the dancing,

539
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:57,652
you cry again.

00:20:57,685 --> 00:20:59,285

541
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:05,419
It's all right, George.

542
00:21:05,452 --> 00:21:07,219
You'll just pay a fine,
and that'll be it.

543
00:21:07,252 --> 00:21:10,652
Why did the policeman have
to yell at me like that?

544
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:12,352
Anna.

545
00:21:12,385 --> 00:21:13,089
Thanks for coming
to pick me up.

546
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:13,719
Thanks for coming
to pick me up.

547
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:15,385
I can explain everything.
All right.

548
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,252
We'll talk about it
at the office.

549
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:19,719
Okay, where's my boy?
Oh, my God.

550
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,519
I'm sitting at home,
reading a periodical,

551
00:21:23,552 --> 00:21:25,552
and this is the call
I get?

552
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,919
My son is a bootlegger?

553
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:29,885
Ow, Dad!

554
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,419
Who put you up to this?
Was it her?

555
00:21:32,452 --> 00:21:34,552
All right. Wait, I think
you've got it backwards.

556
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:37,219
My George isn't clever enough
to hatch a scheme like this.

557
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:38,485
You got that right.

558
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:40,919
What the hell
does that mean?

559
00:21:40,952 --> 00:21:43,089
That means whatever the hell
you want it to mean.

560
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:43,885
That means whatever the hell
you want it to mean.

561
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,785
You saying you want
a piece of me?

562
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:49,785
I could drop you
like a bag of dirt.

563
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:53,819
You want a piece of me?

564
00:21:53,852 --> 00:21:55,185
You got it!

566
00:22:04,498 --> 00:22:06,464
But he's an old man, Elaine.

567
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:09,931
Well, he wrote the check,
and I cashed it.

568
00:22:09,964 --> 00:22:12,464
Look, here's that bootlegged
<i>Death Blow</i> that I shot.

569
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,631
Oh, <i>Cry, Cry Again,</i>
I want to see that.

570
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:15,631
No, you don't.

571
00:22:15,664 --> 00:22:17,731
You shot <i>Death Blow?</i>
Yeah.

572
00:22:17,764 --> 00:22:19,898
It was brilliant.
Thank you.

573
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:22,064
You were big.
I'm still big.

574
00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:24,298
It's the bootlegs
that got small.

575
00:22:24,331 --> 00:22:26,398
How are things at the office?
Back to normal?

576
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:27,731
Yeah, pretty much.

577
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,898
Although I still get the vibe
every once in a while.

578
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,198
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about it.
