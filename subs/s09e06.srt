Bad voodoo.

535
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:33,836
You gotta stop using these.

536
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:34,836
Why?

537
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:35,903
Because they're turning

538
00:19:35,936 --> 00:19:37,369
your teeth green?

539
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:39,203
I only buy the white ones.

540
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:41,169
Okay, well

541
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:43,503
then your teeth are green
for a different reason.

542
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:45,136
You gotta stop
carrying these, okay?

543
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:46,469
Just use mouthwash.

544
00:19:46,503 --> 00:19:49,103
I can't.
It burns my cankers.

545
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:51,136
Binaca.

546
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:53,569
Again.
Right, right. Cankers.

547
00:19:53,603 --> 00:19:53,975
Um, I got it. Chew gum.

548
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,503
Um, I got it. Chew gum.

549
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:56,503
I hate gum.

550
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:57,969
The only gum I liked
came with

551
00:19:58,003 --> 00:19:59,669
the Mickey Mouse
gumball machine.

552
00:19:59,703 --> 00:20:01,669
They stopped making that
20 years ago.

553
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:04,869
Well, stinky,
this is your lucky day.

00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:09,003
Okay, a little later

556
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:10,836
we're gonna be
talking with animal expert,

557
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:12,169
Jim Fowler.

558
00:20:12,203 --> 00:20:13,769
Where are the cameras?

559
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:18,169
But first,
we're talking with...Jerry.

560
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:21,303
Okay, Jerry, uh...

561
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:22,669
...you, uh--
You drugged a woman

562
00:20:22,703 --> 00:20:23,975
in order to play with
her toy collection.

563
00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:26,236
in order to play with
her toy collection.

564
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:28,003
How do you feel about that?

565
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:29,236
It was great.

566
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,169
I've done it
a few more times since then.

567
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:33,903
And she doesn't
know anything about this?

568
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:35,336
Not a thing.
[NEWMAN LAUGHS]

569
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:37,736
Well, Jerry, we have
a little surprise for you.

570
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,669
Come on out, Celia.

571
00:20:39,703 --> 00:20:42,836
What kind of sick,
twisted creep are you?

572
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:44,836
Whoa.
Hey.

573
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:48,136
What-- What is this?
What is she doing here?

574
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:49,236
It's
the new format.

575
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:50,236
Scandals
and animals.

576
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:51,236
Eh, eh, eh.

577
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:52,503
If you think you can drug me

578
00:20:52,536 --> 00:20:53,569
and play with my toys,

579
00:20:53,603 --> 00:20:53,975
you've got another thing
coming, buddy.

580
00:20:53,975 --> 00:20:55,369
you've got another thing
coming, buddy.

581
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:57,369
Go, girl.
Ooh.

582
00:20:57,403 --> 00:21:01,069
W-What kind of woman
drinks an entire box of wine?

583
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:02,203
KRAMER AND NEWMAN:
Ooh.

584
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:04,169
Mr. Fowler,

585
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:05,236
I-I have a squirrel here

586
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:07,069
that is a miracle of
modern science.

587
00:21:07,103 --> 00:21:09,203
[LAUGHS]
George, I told you we're booked.

588
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:12,003
Careful. Hawks and squirrels
don't get along together.

589
00:21:12,036 --> 00:21:13,869
Ooh, another interesting
confrontation.

590
00:21:13,903 --> 00:21:15,169
This could be spicy.
George,

591
00:21:15,203 --> 00:21:16,236
bring him over.
Uh--

592
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:18,369
No, you idiot.
Hawks eat squirrels.

KRAMER:
Are we getting this?

597
00:21:33,336 --> 00:21:35,569
So the whole set
was destroyed?

598
00:21:35,603 --> 00:21:36,903
The squirrel
kept scurrying

599
00:21:36,936 --> 00:21:39,203
and the hawk
kept clawing.

600
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:42,336
Well, at least we know that
prosthetic squirrel hips work.

601
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:44,636
Sorry about the set.

[SIGHS]:
I'll tell you,

603
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:48,869
it was a grind having to
fill 10 hours a day.

604
00:21:48,903 --> 00:21:49,869
I'm not sure
I was ready

605
00:21:49,903 --> 00:21:52,003
to have my own
talk show set.

606
00:21:54,036 --> 00:21:56,803
I got the nut bread, George.
Let's go.

So the squirrel's
gonna make it?

Yeah, he's in my bed.

610
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:01,415
I'm...

611
00:22:01,415 --> 00:22:02,369
I'm...

612
00:22:02,403 --> 00:22:04,169
...sleeping on the couch.

613
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:06,303
On the couch?
So you're--

614
