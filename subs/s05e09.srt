1
00:00:00,602 --> 00:00:01,902
With a serial killer loose,

2
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:04,636
seems like the safest thing
is to be the neighbor.

3
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:05,936
They never kill
the neighbor.

4
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:07,169
The neighbor always survives

5
00:00:07,203 --> 00:00:09,203
to do the interview
afterwards, right?

6
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:10,969
"Uh, he was kind of quiet."

7
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:12,303
I love these neighbors.

8
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:14,536
They're never disturbed
by the sounds of murdering.

9
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:15,669
Just stereo.

10
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:17,703
Chain saws,
people screaming, fine.

11
00:00:17,736 --> 00:00:20,336
Just keep the music down.

12
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,003
And all these women that always
fall in love with the killer.

13
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:24,336
They write to him in prison.

14
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:26,803
Here's a woman
that's hard to disappoint.

15
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:28,803
I guess she's only upset
when she finds out

16
00:00:28,836 --> 00:00:30,000
he's stopped
killing people.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,303
he's stopped
killing people.

18
00:00:30,336 --> 00:00:32,469
And she goes,
"You know, sometimes I feel like

19
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:34,736
I don't even know
who you are anymore."

20
00:00:37,669 --> 00:00:40,836
[â™ª]

21
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:43,891
JERRY [ON PHONE]:
<i>Eight years</i> <i>isn't such a long streak.</i>

22
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:44,958
It isn't?

23
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:47,458
No. I haven't vomited
in 13 years.

24
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:49,958
Get out!

25
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:52,925
Not since June 29, 1980.

26
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:54,891
You remember the date?

27
00:00:54,925 --> 00:01:00,991
Yes. Because my previous
vomit was also June 29, 1972.

28
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:03,291
That's why during
the '80 vomit,

29
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:04,958
I was yelling to George,

30
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:06,158
"Can you believe it?

31
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:06,578
I'm vomiting
on June 29th again."

32
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:09,225
I'm vomiting
on June 29th again."

33
00:01:09,258 --> 00:01:11,391
Boy, you know, when Joel told me
he hadn't thrown up

34
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:12,658
in eight years,

35
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:14,391
I was wondering
if he was normal.

36
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:15,625
<i>No, Elaine, he's normal.</i>

37
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,058
Your boyfriend
is a normal guy.

38
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:19,825
He just has the same name as one
of the worst serial killers

39
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:20,958
in the history of New York.

40
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:22,391
Yeah.

41
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:25,125
Oh, Jer,
I got to go.

42
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:26,258
Hi.
Hey.

43
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,825
We just saw your boyfriend
at a bus stop.

44
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:29,825
Oh, yeah?

45
00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:31,391
Yeah. What's his name?

46
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,391
Joel.

47
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,458
Joel what?

48
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:35,091
Uh, Rifkin.

49
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,558
Rifkin?

50
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:37,558
Joel Rifkin?

51
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:39,558
Yeah. It's just
a coincidence,

52
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:40,658
obviously.

53
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:42,958
Guess you better keep
on his good side.

54
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:45,758
Very funny.
That's very funny.

55
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,891
Yeah, I wouldn't sleep
with my back to him

56
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:49,325
if I were you.

57
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:51,658
Yeah. Well, that's
enough of that.

58
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:53,325
Elaine, listen,
if you smell anything

59
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:54,958
decaying in the trunk
of his car--

60
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,991
Look, this is my boyfriend
we're talking about!

61
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:58,658
He's a gentleman,
he's good-looking,

62
00:01:58,691 --> 00:01:59,958
he's a good shaver

63
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:01,725
and he hasn't thrown up
in eight years.

64
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:02,925
So just shut up about him.

65
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:03,991
Shut up!

66
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:08,391
The whole city
is talking

67
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:10,058
about this monster,
Joel Rifkin.

68
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:12,125
And I am dating
a Joel Rifkin.

69
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:13,491
But you like
your Joel Rifkin.

70
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:16,925
Yeah. I just wish he had
a different name.

71
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,458
Ask him
to change it.

72
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:21,325
You can't ask a person
to change their name.

73
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:22,325
Why not?

74
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:24,058
Would you
change yours?

75
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:25,625
If someone asked me nicely.

76
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,491
I'm Claude Seinfeld.

77
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,791
Hey, how many people
did Rifkin strangle, 18?

78
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:34,291
Yeah,
18 strangles.

79
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:36,578
Well, you know why Rifkin
was a serial killer?

80
00:02:36,578 --> 00:02:36,591
Well, you know why Rifkin
was a serial killer?

81
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,825
Because he was adopted.

82
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:42,725
Just like Son of Sam
was adopted.

83
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:43,725
So apparently,

84
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:45,825
adoption leads
to serial killing.

85
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:52,491
You know, Joel and I have an
extra ticket to the Giants game.

86
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:53,525
I'll go.
Okay.

87
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:56,758
I'll leave a ticket for you
at will call.

88
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,291
Yeah! Ooh!

89
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:03,125
You think I should have
asked George?

90
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:05,291
Hey, did you hear George
got back with Karen?

91
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:06,578
Karen?

92
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:06,591
Karen?

93
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,558
Risotto.

94
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:09,758
I feel full
after the risotto.

95
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,258
Oh, the risotto broad.

96
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,491
Yeah.

97
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:15,125
He's really got
a good thing with her.

98
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:16,925
In fact, I'm doubling
with them tonight.

99
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,591
Thought you didn't like
double dates.

100
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,558
George likes them. He feels it's
a good personality showcase.

101
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:24,225
He likes a date to see him
with a friend,

102
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:26,791
so she can get a window
into his non-date personality.

103
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:28,591
I've looked
through that window

104
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,791
and screamed at him
to shut the blinds.

105
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,991
He feels he's funnier,
more relaxed.

106
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:36,558
Uh-huh. And you're taking?

107
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,758
Jodi, the masseuse.

108
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,091
Oh, did you get
a massage yet?

109
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,125
No. How many times
do I have to go out with her,

110
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:42,758
before I get a massage?

111
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,758
Jerry, she gives
massages all day.

112
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,425
She doesn't want
to give them on dates.

113
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,891
Yeah, I know.
She just wants to have sex.

114
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:52,391
So what?

115
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:55,225
So it's like going to Idaho
and eating carrots.

116
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:57,158
I like carrots,
but I'm in Idaho,

117
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:59,491
I want a potato.

118
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:03,458
So I go into
this clothing store,

119
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:05,258
and the saleswoman
is wearing this, uh...

120
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,258
[WHISTLES]

121
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:06,578
Low-cut thing.

122
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:07,558
Low-cut thing.

123
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:10,125
So I said to her,
"Can I ask you a question?

124
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:12,291
"When you put on
a top like that,

125
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:14,158
"what's your
thought process?

126
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:16,558
What's going on
in your mind?"

127
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:18,491
Oh, that is so funny.

128
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:21,825
You listening to this?

129
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:23,825
Yeah,
I heard you.

130
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:25,958
Boy, my neck
is killing me.

131
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:28,225
It's, like, right
in this spot.

132
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:29,658
Very tender
over here.

133
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:31,425
So, what did
she say?

134
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,858
Well, nothing.
I didn't actually say that.

135
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:36,578
You just said
that you said it.

136
00:04:36,578 --> 00:04:37,491
You just said
that you said it.

137
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:40,325
Sweetheart,
I was exaggerating.

138
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:42,925
I'm learning a lot
about you tonight, George.

139
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,991
I've never seen
you like this.

140
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,825
It's like somebody's pulling
on wires back here.

141
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:53,391
You know, it's like you never
see a really attractive woman

142
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:55,158
getting a traffic ticket.

143
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:56,658
How can
you say that?

144
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:58,825
My sister got
a ticket last week.

145
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:01,591
Are you saying
she's not attractive?

146
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,058
Well, I've never met
your sister.

147
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:05,258
But obviously, these are not
hard-and-fast rules.

148
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,578
Darling, the tea is getting
a little cold, sweetheart.

149
00:05:06,578 --> 00:05:07,625
Darling, the tea is getting
a little cold, sweetheart.

150
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:09,058
Can we go?
Yeah, let's go.

151
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:10,091
So soon?

152
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,425
Yeah. Good seeing
you again, Karen.

153
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,458
Nice meeting you, Karen.

154
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:14,591
Nice to meet you too.

155
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,258
I'm gonna
call you about that massage.

156
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,791
Jodi, let's do this again
real soon.

157
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:18,991
Yeah.

158
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,125
I strained my neck
last night.

159
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,291
Really?
Yeah.

160
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:27,391
How?

161
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:28,991
Well, I tried
brushing my teeth

162
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:30,091
by holding the brush

163
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,791
and moving my head
from side to side.

164
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:33,958
It didn't work.

165
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:36,578
So, what's the deal
with your friend, George?

166
00:05:36,578 --> 00:05:37,825
So, what's the deal
with your friend, George?

167
00:05:37,858 --> 00:05:39,091
No deal, why?

168
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,658
What was all that
"attractive women

169
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:43,225
not getting tickets"
nonsense?

170
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:44,791
Oh, well, he was
just showcasing

171
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:46,425
his non-date
personality.

172
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,291
I don't know how you
can hang out with that guy.

173
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:52,658
Yeah, sometimes it really
makes me tense.

174
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:56,425
Did you see the way
that he was eating?

175
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,225
Yeah,
he's disgusting.

176
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,091
I have to tell you,

177
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,925
I really
don't like him.

178
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,091
Yeah, me either.

179
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,991
It's just
I hate that type.

180
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:06,158
Ah, he's a bad seed.

181
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:10,158
Now, you, however,

182
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:12,258
you, I like.

183
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,591
Uh, what are you doing?

184
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,291
What do you think
I'm doing?

185
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:21,258
So, what do you think?

186
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,425
Really enjoyed it.

187
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,425
Jodi's nice.

188
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,091
She's very nice.

189
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,325
Let's discuss
this later.

190
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:30,258
You think she liked me?
She seemed to like me.

191
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,291
Mm-hm.

192
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,425
I was personable,
don't you think?

193
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,578
You were extremely
personable.

194
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:36,958
You were extremely
personable.

195
00:06:36,991 --> 00:06:39,591
'Cause I thought I picked up
a little something.

196
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,325
I'm very good at this.

197
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:42,925
Did you pick up anything?

198
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,391
I didn't pick up anything.

199
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:47,191
The second time I sent
the noodles back...

200
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:50,558
I-- I thought
she made a face.

201
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:52,458
I didn't see a face.

202
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,458
I thought
I saw a face.

203
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:56,958
Anyhow, what's
the difference?

204
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:58,725
No difference.
I could care less.

205
00:06:58,758 --> 00:06:59,925
She's Jerry's girlfriend.

206
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,591
George, instead of
talking about this,

207
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,591
we could be, uh...

208
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,891
You know.

209
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,225
Heh, heh, heh, heh.

210
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:06,578
So you think
she liked me?

211
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:08,425
So you think
she liked me?

212
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,658
Ohh!

213
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,825
What are you doing?

214
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:19,758
Massaging your neck.

215
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,958
Oh, heh.

216
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:24,491
Of course.

217
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:26,258
Massaging.

218
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,425
Uh, boning up
on football?

219
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,958
Yeah. Yeah.
You know what?

220
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:34,225
There are a lot of players
named Deion these days.

221
00:07:34,258 --> 00:07:36,578
What a cool name, Deion.

222
00:07:36,578 --> 00:07:38,158
What a cool name, Deion.

223
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,591
If I were going to
change my name,

224
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,658
I'd go with Deion.

225
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:42,891
Deion Benes?

226
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:46,658
Well, as a woman,
it makes no sense.

227
00:07:46,691 --> 00:07:49,825
But, I mean, well,
let's say I was you.

228
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:52,291
And I decided I was gonna
change my name,

229
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:54,458
for no real reason
whatsoever.

230
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:56,691
Deion Rifkin.

231
00:07:57,858 --> 00:08:02,158
Wow!
That is so cool.

232
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:05,058
D-Deion Rifkin?

233
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:06,578
Well, maybe you're
not the Deion type.

234
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:07,458
Well, maybe you're
not the Deion type.

235
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:09,458
Okay then, let's see,
let's see, what do we got?

236
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:11,291
Oh! Oh! Oh!

237
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:12,425
O.J.!

238
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,391
O.J. Rifkin! Oh!

239
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:16,325
You don't even use a name,
it's just initials.

240
00:08:16,358 --> 00:08:18,625
Oh, please, please,
change your name to O.J.

241
00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:19,791
It would be so great!

242
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:21,991
Elaine,
what is going on?

243
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:26,825
She stayed over?

244
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:29,325
Yeah.

245
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:30,791
Sex wasn't so good?

246
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:32,425
No. Sex was fabulous.

247
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:34,658
So?

248
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:36,578
I want the massage!

249
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:38,125
I want the massage!

250
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:40,125
Did you ask her?

251
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,125
I tried putting her hands there.
She pulls it away immediately.

252
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:44,125
She's not into it.

253
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:45,125
Why not?

254
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,758
I guess 'cause it's her job.

255
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,791
It's very frustrating.

256
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:53,158
So, uh, we had a good time,
huh, the four of us.

257
00:08:53,191 --> 00:08:54,758
Yeah.

258
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,991
We all got along.
Everyone seemed very pleasant.

259
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:58,225
Yeah.

260
00:08:58,258 --> 00:08:59,258
What did Jodi say?

261
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,325
She had a good time.

262
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:01,591
That it?

263
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,091
Pretty much.

264
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,578
She say anything
about, uh...?

265
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:07,491
She say anything
about, uh...?

266
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:08,558
What?

267
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:10,091
Nah, it's all right, great!

268
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,225
She had a good time.

269
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:14,558
Yeah.

270
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:15,558
You just hesitated.

271
00:09:15,591 --> 00:09:17,125
I was blowin' on the coffee.

272
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:18,925
She didn't like me.

273
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,825
Look, it's not like
you're gonna be spending

274
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:23,091
a lot of time with her.

275
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,658
So she doesn't like me?

276
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:25,858
No.

277
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:29,925
She said that?

278
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,091
Yes.

279
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,491
She told you
she doesn't like me?

280
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:34,658
Yes.

281
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:36,578
What were her exact--?
"I don't like him."

282
00:09:36,578 --> 00:09:36,591
What were her exact--?
"I don't like him."

283
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:41,758
Uh-huh.

284
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,158
Why didn't she
like me?

285
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,625
Not everybody
likes everybody.

286
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:47,558
I wasn't nice?
You were very nice!

287
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:50,591
I bent over backwards
for that woman!

288
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,125
Was it what I said
about her sister?

289
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,758
It has nothing to do
with the sister.

290
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,058
I don't even know
her sister!

291
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:57,225
But believe me, if she's getting
traffic tickets,

292
00:09:57,258 --> 00:09:58,991
she's not
that good-looking!

293
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,825
You vomited in 1987.

294
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:05,158
Oh, no. That was
the dry heaves.

295
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:06,225
Jodi!

296
00:10:06,258 --> 00:10:06,578
Hi, Jerry.

297
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:07,225
Hi, Jerry.

298
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:09,758
Ha, ha, hey!

299
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,725
What are you
doing here?

300
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:13,158
I was giving Kramer
a massage.

301
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:16,758
Kramer!

302
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,658
I gotta run.
I have an appointment downtown.

303
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:20,158
Let me take your table
downstairs.

304
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:21,225
No, that's okay

305
00:10:21,258 --> 00:10:23,091
Give it to me,
I love to help people.

306
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,458
Come on.
I'm going this way.

307
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:26,858
I'll see you tonight.

308
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:32,058
Hey!

309
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:33,825
I am looser
than creamed corn.

310
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:35,425
Who told you to get
a massage from her?

311
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,578
I haven't gotten
a massage from her yet!

312
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:37,125
I haven't gotten
a massage from her yet!

313
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:39,025
You don't know what
you're missing, buddy.

314
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:42,625
No one hails
a cab like me.

315
00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:44,558
My hailing technique
is unmatched.

316
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:46,591
See, I get the wrist going
side to side and boom!

317
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,958
Cabs are crashing into
themselves to just pick me up.

318
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:53,058
All right, here we go.
Let me get the door.

319
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:55,425
Feminists aside, I know
women like the door-holding.

320
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:59,725
Here we are.
Alrighty. Good. Okay.

321
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,625
Jodi, let's get
together again real soon.

322
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:02,958
Say hello
to your sister for me.

323
00:11:02,991 --> 00:11:04,225
You've never met.

324
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:05,225
Whatever. Believe me,

325
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:06,578
if I wasn't
involved right now,

326
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:06,958
if I wasn't
involved right now,

327
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:08,291
I wouldn't mind
being set up.

328
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:10,025
Something tells me
she's a knockout!

329
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,625
But first, she sets
the mood perfectly

330
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:17,958
with this New Age music
played over ocean sounds.

331
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:20,091
Then she lays you out
on this table,

332
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,925
and she proceeds
to rub oil

333
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,391
over your entire body.

334
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:30,558
And she rubs long
and deep.

335
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:33,025
Jerry, she rubs with love.

336
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:36,578
Every muscle
she touches just...

337
00:11:36,578 --> 00:11:37,658
Every muscle
she touches just...

338
00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:40,391
oozes...

339
00:11:40,425 --> 00:11:42,725
beneath those silky,
soft fingers.

340
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:45,491
You can scarcely
contain yourself, buddy.

341
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:46,891
So you had a good time, huh?

342
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:48,258
Oh, yeah.

343
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,291
Enjoyed yourself?

344
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:50,591
Very much.

345
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:54,058
All right, now, you listen,
and you listen good!

346
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:55,058
What?

347
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:56,091
The massages are out!

348
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,291
What--?
Aah! They're out!

349
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:58,758
Why?

350
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,958
Because if I can't get one,
you're not getting one!

351
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:03,625
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I need my massages.

352
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:05,325
Can't you see
I'm burned out?

353
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,758
I'm sorry, Kramer.

354
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,791
Why?

trying to clear the air.

531
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,758
I just know, if I could spend
some time alone with her...

532
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,725
I've got to.
I've got to.

533
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:52,758
You're going now?

534
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,558
Well, I think I can
still catch her.

535
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,591
All right, George, I have had
just about enough of this.

536
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,225
What? What are you
talking about?

537
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:01,325
I am talking about
you and Jodi.

538
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:03,291
You're completely
obsessed with her.

539
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:06,425
I know. I know.

540
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,055
Who is more important
to you, her or me?

541
00:19:07,055 --> 00:19:09,158
Who is more important
to you, her or me?

542
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,658
I like you, she doesn't.

543
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,625
Who you gonna pick?

544
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,625
I'm sorry, Karen.
I know I care for you,

545
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:22,825
but I just can't stand
when someone doesn't like me.

546
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:24,491
Well, now I hate you!

547
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:26,491
That, I'm used to.

548
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,758
Ned?

549
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,491
What is wrong
with Ned?

550
00:19:31,025 --> 00:19:32,225
No.

551
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:35,758
Ned's a guy who buys
irregular underwear.

552
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,958
Next.

553
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:37,055
Ellis.

554
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:40,258
Ellis.

555
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,491
Ellis? You might as well
go with Alex.

556
00:19:42,525 --> 00:19:43,591
It's the same thing.

557
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,625
Ellis and Alex
aren't even close.

558
00:19:46,658 --> 00:19:49,425
Next!
Oh! What's the point?

559
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,925
No, no, come on!

560
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,325
Okay, okay.

561
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,925
Remy.

562
00:19:57,925 --> 00:19:59,925
Remy Rifkin?
Mm-hm.

563
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,458
Should I get a beret?

564
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:06,091
Oh, Stuart's a lot better.

565
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,055
Little Stuart Rifkin

566
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:07,458
Little Stuart Rifkin

567
00:20:07,491 --> 00:20:09,825
likes to go shopping
with his mother.

568
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:14,725
JERRY:
What do you mean, no?

569
00:20:14,758 --> 00:20:16,558
No means no.

570
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,625
Look, who are you kidding?

571
00:20:17,658 --> 00:20:18,791
You come up
to my apartment

572
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:20,891
with your table
and your little oils.

573
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:23,391
And I'm not supposed
to expect anything?

574
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:25,825
You're a massage teaser.

575
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:30,725
Listen, I massage who I want
when I want.

576
00:20:30,758 --> 00:20:33,791
I don't submit
to forcible massage.

577
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:40,258
I'm getting out of here.

578
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,025
Fine, go.

579
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,058
Jerry, could you excuse us
for a few minutes, please?

580
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:55,758
What for?

581
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:56,991
We need to talk.

582
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:58,325
You need to talk?

583
00:20:58,358 --> 00:20:59,658
We have nothing
to talk about.

584
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,925
It's no secret
what's going on between us.

585
00:21:03,258 --> 00:21:04,791
She doesn't like me.

586
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:06,125
Now, Jerry,
if you don't mind.

587
00:21:06,158 --> 00:21:07,055
George, anything you have
to say to her

588
00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:07,791
George, anything you have
to say to her

589
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:08,958
you can say
in front of me.

590
00:21:13,658 --> 00:21:14,658
Jerry...

591
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:17,991
this woman
hates me so much

592
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:21,658
I'm starting to like her.

593
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:22,658
What?

594
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:25,558
She just dislikes me
so much...

595
00:21:25,591 --> 00:21:27,291
it's irresistible.

596
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:30,425
I can see that.

597
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,891
I'm getting out of here.

598
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,625
Don't call me.
Don't worry.

599
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,591
A woman that hates me
this much

600
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,825
comes along
once in a lifetime.

601
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:44,325
You're a lucky guy.

602
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,391
I got to go after her.

603
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:48,991
George.

604
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:51,758
I wouldn't push
for the massage.

605
00:21:53,658 --> 00:21:55,325
Jodi!

606
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,491
[â™ª]

607
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:07,487
The Swedish are very big
massagers, you know.

608
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,787
They like the Swedish meatballs,
Swedish massage.

609
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,987
They like having meat
in their hands, these people.

610
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,420
For some reason.
But it's weird.

611
00:22:13,453 --> 00:22:15,087
Because they have
a high suicide rate.

612
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,453
They're rubbing
each other's necks all the time.

613
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:20,053
For a neutral country,
they seem kind of tense.

614
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:22,887
I don't really like the idea of
getting a professional massage.

615
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,953
I don't want people touching me
that don't know me

616
00:22:24,987 --> 00:22:26,587
and don't want to have
sex with me.

617
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,920
What are you bothering me for?

618
00:22:27,953 --> 00:22:29,787
You get me all loosened up,
juices flowing,

619
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,920
then, "That's it. Okay.
You're done."

620
00:22:32,953 --> 00:22:34,532
Like having chocolate
rubbed all over your face.

621
00:22:34,532 --> 00:22:35,253
Like having chocolate
rubbed all over your face.

622
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:38,220
You want to go, "Excuse me.
I think you missed a spot."

623
00:22:38,253 --> 00:22:40,587
[â™ª]
