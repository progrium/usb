00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:55,868
Oh, by the way,
Mr. Testikov, um...

529
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:58,401
Do you remember
the other day

530
00:17:58,435 --> 00:18:00,768
when we were
in the limo, and, uh,

531
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:03,568
my organizer started
making noise,

532
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:05,735
and you threw it
out the window?

533
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:07,368
How can I forget?

534
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:10,335
Well, um,
would you believe

535
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:13,101
that it actually hit
somebody in the head?

536
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:14,401
Right in the head.

537
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:15,901
Boing! Heh, heh.
[SQUEAKING]

538
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:17,820
What is that noise?

539
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,535
What is that noise?

540
00:18:18,568 --> 00:18:20,001
Uh, that's nothin'.

541
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:21,868
Um, and anyway, um--

542
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,301
What's going on, huh?

543
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:25,235
That noise!
No--

544
00:18:25,268 --> 00:18:26,701
No, that's my purse.
That noise!

545
00:18:26,735 --> 00:18:28,501
No, get--
Get off my purse!

546
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:30,435
It's a recorder! Huh!
No, that's a radio!

547
00:18:30,468 --> 00:18:32,035
You are spying on me!

548
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:40,901
[WHISTLING]

549
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:47,820
[WHIZZING]

550
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,435
[WHIZZING]

551
00:18:50,635 --> 00:18:52,068
Aah!

552
00:18:52,101 --> 00:18:54,501
CROWD: Come on!
MAN: Save the whale.

553
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:55,601
You gotta
do it!

554
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,768
Save the whale,
George...for me.

555
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:17,820
GEORGE:
<i>So, I started to walk</i> <i>into the water.</i>

556
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,801
GEORGE:
<i>So, I started to walk</i> <i>into the water.</i>

557
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:22,901
<i>I won't lie to you, boys.</i>

558
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:24,035
I was terrified,

559
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:26,435
but I pressed on.

560
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:28,701
And as I made my way
past the breakers,

561
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,335
a strange calm came
over me.

562
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:32,401
I-- I don't know if it was
divine intervention

563
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:33,935
or the kinship
of all living things,

564
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:36,101
but I tell you, Jerry,
at that moment,

565
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:38,768
I was
a marine biologist.

566
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:43,568
George, I've just been
reading this thing in the paper.

567
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:44,735
It's unbelievable.

568
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:46,435
I know, I was
just telling the story.

569
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:47,820
Well, come on, George.
Finish the story.

570
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,435
Well, come on, George.
Finish the story.

571
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,768
The sea was angry
that day, my friends...

572
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:58,735
like an old man trying
to send back soup in a deli.

573
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:07,868
I got about 50 feet out
when suddenly,

574
00:20:07,901 --> 00:20:11,001
the great beast
appeared before me.

575
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:13,401
I tell ya, he was 10 stories
high if he was a foot!

576
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:17,820
As if sensing my presence,
he let out a great bellow.

577
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,168
As if sensing my presence,
he let out a great bellow.

578
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:20,368
I said,
"Easy, big fella."

579
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:25,535
And then, as I watched
him struggling, I realized

580
00:20:25,568 --> 00:20:28,001
that something was
obstructing its breathing.

581
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:30,001
From where I was standing,
I could see directly

582
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:31,335
into the eye
of the great fish.

583
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:32,335
Mammal.

584
00:20:32,368 --> 00:20:33,401
Whatever.

585
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:35,601
Well, what did you do next?

586
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:36,668
Well, then,

587
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:37,668
from out of nowhere,

588
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:39,935
a huge tidal wave
lifted me,

589
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:41,068
tossed me like a cork,

590
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:43,001
and I found myself
right on top of him,

591
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:44,568
face-to-face
with the blowhole!

592
00:20:44,601 --> 00:20:47,820
I-I-I could barely see from
the waves crashing down upon me,

593
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,501
I-I-I could barely see from
the waves crashing down upon me,

594
00:20:48,535 --> 00:20:51,335
but...I knew something
was there,

595
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:54,168
so I reached my hand
in, felt around,

596
00:20:54,201 --> 00:20:55,801
and pulled out
the obstruction!

597
00:21:17,135 --> 00:21:17,820
What is that,
a Titleist?

598
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,535
What is that,
a Titleist?

599
00:21:22,635 --> 00:21:24,201
A hole in one, huh?

600
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:36,156
The crowd must
have gone wild.

601
00:21:36,189 --> 00:21:38,656
Oh, yes. Yes.

602
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:40,522
Yes, Jerry, they were
all over me.

603
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:42,389
It was like <i>Rocky I.</i>

604
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:46,522
Diane came up to me,

605
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:49,356
threw her arms
around me,

606
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:50,389
kissed me.

607
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:54,189
We both had tears
streaming down our faces.

608
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,522
I never saw anyone
so beautiful.

609
00:21:59,022 --> 00:22:02,322
It was at that moment
that I decided to tell her that

610
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:03,167
I was not
a marine biologist.

611
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,456
I was not
a marine biologist.

612
00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:07,522
Wow. What did she say?

613
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:09,822
Told me to "go to hell,"
and I took the bus home.

614
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:11,956
All right. Let's go.

615
00:22:14,356 --> 00:22:15,489
What, are you
in a bad mood?

616
00:22:15,522 --> 00:22:17,522
Nah, I got my laundry back.

617
00:22:17,556 --> 00:22:18,989
[GASPS]

618
00:22:19,022 --> 00:22:20,156
Golden Boy?

619
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:21,856
He didn't make it.

620
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:25,922
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

621
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:28,589
This is
Golden Boy's son...

622
00:22:28,622 --> 00:22:29,722
Baby Blue.

623
00:22:32,189 --> 00:22:33,167
What's with you?

624
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:33,189
What's with you?

625
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:35,189
Sand.
It's everywhere!
