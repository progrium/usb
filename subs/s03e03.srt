00:00:01,666 --> 00:00:05,500
I have never seen an old person
in a new bathing suit.

2
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:06,833
In my life.

3
00:00:06,866 --> 00:00:09,033
I don't know where they get
their bathing suits,

4
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:12,033
but my father has bathing suits
from other centuries,

5
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:13,633
and my parents live in Florida,

6
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,200
and if you go down there,

7
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:16,700
and you forget
your bathing suit,

8
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:19,366
then they want you to wear
one of theirs.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,466
You know how that gets?

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,533
You need trunks, son?
I've got trunks for you.

11
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,633
You can wear my trunks.

12
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:27,633
Fathers don't wear
bathing suits,

13
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:28,633
they wear trunks.

14
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,000
It's kind of the same thing

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,500
It's kind of the same thing

16
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:32,800
a tree would wear
if it went swimming.

17
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,000
So I get in the water
in this thing,

18
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:38,800
and it's, like,
floating around me somewhere.

19
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,366
Have you ever
put on a bathing suit

20
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,533
that you don't even know

21
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:44,166
exactly where you are
inside the bathing suit?

22
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,466
You bump into somebody you know,
"No, I'm parasailing.

23
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,166
I'm waiting
for the boat to come back."

24

to be here at 7:30.

What happened
to the scotch tape?

27
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:02,000
Who takes
the scotch tape?

28
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:04,800
Nobody returns anything
around here.

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,633

So, what took you so long?

We waited 35 minutes
in the rent-a-car place.

I don't know why
you had to rent a car.

43
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:29,700
We would have
picked you up.

44
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:30,700
What's the difference?

45
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,066
Well, you could have
used our car.

I don't want to use your car.

with our car?

Nothing, it's a fine car,
what if you want to use it?

We don't use it.

You would hitch?

Oh, you're crazy.

You don't need
the air conditioner.

your speech all ready?

What kind of pen is that?

179
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,200
This pen?

180
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,300
Yeah.

181
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,533
Oh, this is
an astronaut pen.

182
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:44,533
It writes upside down.
They use this in space.

183
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:46,200
Oh, that's
the astronaut pen.

184
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,033
I heard about that.
Where did you get it?

185
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:49,800
It was a gift.

186
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:50,008
A lot of times
I write in bed,

187
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:52,066
A lot of times
I write in bed,

188
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,066
and I have to turn
and lean on my elbow

189
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,466
to make the pen work.

190
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,466
Take the pen.

191
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,533
Oh, no.

192
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,800
Go ahead.
I couldn't.

193
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,866
Come on, take the pen!

194
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,200
I can't take it.

195
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03,866
Do me a favor!
I'm not comfortable.

196
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,233
Take the pen!
I cannot take it.

197
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:06,466
Take the pen?

198
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,966
Are you sure?
I'm Positive.
Take the pen.

199
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,900
Okay, thank you
very much.

200
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,466
Thank you. Gee, boy.

201
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,866
Jack, what are you doing?

202
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,866
Stop it.

203
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,733
Jack, we should go.

204
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,300
It was nice meeting you.

205
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,300
Mm, nice to meet you.

206
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,800
Thanks again.
Come on!

207
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,066
She's adorable.

208
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,066
What did you take his pen for?

209
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,066
What? He gave it to me.

210
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,566
You didn't have to take it.

211
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,966
Oh, my God, she's gotta make
a big deal out of everything.

212
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,066
He offered it to me.

213
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,866
Because you made
such a big fuss about it.

214
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,133
Well, I liked it.
Should I have said I didn't?

215
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,566
You shouldn't have
said anything.

216
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,300
What do you
expect him to do?

217
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,008
He could have said,
"Thank you, I like it too,"

218
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:50,300
He could have said,
"Thank you, I like it too,"

219
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,466
and put it in his pocket.

220
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,033
He loves that pen.

221
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:54,300
Aw, come on.

222
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,700
He talks about it all the time.

223
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:56,900
Every time he takes it out,

224
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,300
he goes on and on about

225
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,300
how it writes upside down,
how the astronauts use it.

226
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,966
If he likes it so much, then
he never should have offered it.

227
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,133
He didn't think you'd accept.
Well, he was wrong.

228
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:09,533
I know his wife.
She has some mouth on her.

229
00:07:09,566 --> 00:07:10,966
She'll tell everyone
in the condo now

230
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,633
that you made him
give you the pen.

231
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,966
They're talking
about it right now.

232
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,633
So you want me to return it?

233
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,866
Yes.

234
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,008
DAD: He's not going
to return that pen.

235
00:07:20,008 --> 00:07:20,133
DAD: He's not going
to return that pen.

236
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,133
That's ridiculous.

237
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,366
I don't want the pen now!

238
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,966
Jack can afford
to give away a pen

239
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,533
with all his money, believe me.

240
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:28,233
He gives me a check for 19.45.

241
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:30,666
He didn't have a Coke.
Ho-ho-ho!

242
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:35,066
Here, let me see it.

243
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,066
Hey, it writes upside down.

244
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:50,008

245
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:50,133

246
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,400
Come in.

247
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,966
You okay in here?

248
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,066
Why is it so hot in here?

249
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,200
How can they sleep like this?

250
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,400
It's only for three days.

251
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:07,300
Today's over,
then we have tomorrow.

252
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,333
We leave on Sunday.
It's one day, really.

253
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:16,700
Oh. What is with this bar?

254
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:18,700
It's right in my back.
It's killing me.

255
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:19,900
Oh, do you want
to switch?

256
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:20,008
I'm sleeping in the love seat

257
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:21,533
I'm sleeping in the love seat

258
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:24,633
I've got my feet up in the air
like I'm in a space capsule.

259
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,900
I am never going to fall asleep.

260
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:29,566
Oh, no don't say that.
You'll jinx me.

261
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,700
How can they not put
the air conditioning on?

262
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:36,433
They're nuts with temperature.

263
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,566
Oh, this bar
is right on my back.

264
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:47,633
It's making a dent.

265
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,008
How about that guy
writing a check for 19.45?

266
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:53,633
How about that guy
writing a check for 19.45?

267
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,366
I'm sweating here.

268
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,300
I'm in bed, sweating.

269
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,366
It's one day.

270
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,533
Half a day, really.

271
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:06,366
I mean,
you subtract showers and meals,

272
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,800
it's like 20 minutes.

273
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,766
It'll go by like that.

274
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:16,133
Stay on 95 South
to Biscayne Boulevard.

275
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,900
Then you make a left turn.

276
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:20,008
Put your blinker on immediately.
There's an abutment there.

277
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:22,200
Put your blinker on immediately.
There's an abutment there.

278
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:24,133
Then you're going to merge over
very quickly,

279
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,466
but stay on Biscayne.

280
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,066
Don't get off Biscayne.
Do you understand me?

281
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,866
Stay on Biscayne.

282
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,533
You're going
underwater?

283
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:33,900
Yes, generally, that's where
scuba diving is done.

284
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:36,533
What do you have to go
underwater for?

285
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:37,833
What's down there
that's so special?

286
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,166
What's so special up here?

287
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:42,533
Oh.

288
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:43,800
Oh.

289
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,800
What's the matter?

290
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,133
Oh, my back.

291
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,466
Well, what happened?

292
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,133
That-- that bed.

293
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,008
The bar was right in my back.

294
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:51,733
The bar was right in my back.

295
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:54,366
I told you
to let us sleep in there.

296
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,800
Then you would be
hunched over.

297
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:59,466
Oh, I don't even know
if I can go scuba diving.

298
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,466
You can't go?

299
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,966
So stay home.

300
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,133
You can go.

301
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,300
Without you?

302
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,966
That's the whole reason
you came down here.

303
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,533
Don't go.

304
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,466
You sure?
Maybe you should
see a doctor.

305
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,700
We'll stay in a hotel tonight.

306
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:12,366
MOM: No, we'll stay
in there.

307
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,900
Why don't you get a new sofa?

308
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:16,300
Nobody uses it.

309
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,366
I'm buying you a new sofa.

310
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,008
Oh, Jerry, don't talk crazy.

311
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:20,366
Oh, Jerry, don't talk crazy.

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,700
I am begging you...

314
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:27,766
put the air conditioner on.

315
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,066
You're hot?

316
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,700
I've lost six pounds.

317
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:39,800
I don't even know
to to work it.

318
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,433
I keep telling her
it's like an oven in here.

319
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:45,966
Is everybody up?

320
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,966
Hi. How are you?

Hi, Evelyn.

325
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:54,900
Jerry, you got thin.

326
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:57,066
Too thin?

327
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,500
Oh, stop worrying so much
about how you look.

328
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,500
So where's the new pen?

329
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,133
What?

330
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,366

the one Jack Clompers gave you.

331
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,300
How did you know that?

332
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,008
Blanche told me.

333
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:20,466
Blanche told me.

334
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,466
Blanche?

335
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,466
That's some good pen.

00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,466
What did Blanche say?

339
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,466
I don't know,

340
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,033
she said Jerry
wanted the pen.

341
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:36,366
I never really wanted the pen.

342
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,466
He gave him the pen.

344
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:40,066
Why? You don't
like the pen?

345
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,466
No, no, I...

346
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,466
If you don't like it,
give it back to him.

347
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,866
Is that what she said?

348

00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,866
Jerry wouldn't do that.

357
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,966
Jack gave it to him.

358
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,066
All he said

359
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,033
was he liked it.

360
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:05,966
I mean, nobody put
a gun to his head.

361
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,033
You're giving him
back that pen.

362
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:13,733
Somebody, please,
the air conditioner.

363
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,533
Oh, my God,
I forget all about it.

364
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:19,733
All I said was,
"I like the pen."

365
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:20,008
How the hell
do you work this thing?

366
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:22,066
How the hell
do you work this thing?

367
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:29,528
Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.

368
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:31,862
Oh, no, no,
I want to go.

369
00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:33,028
But your back hurts.

370
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:34,462
Maybe a couple
of muscle relaxers

371
00:12:34,495 --> 00:12:35,462
would help.

372
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:37,395
Oh. Oh, okay.

373
00:12:39,762 --> 00:12:41,195
You can turn down
the air conditioning

374
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,195

No, I'm fine.

377
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:47,428
No.

378
00:12:49,262 --> 00:12:50,295
Don't be alarmed.

379
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:51,295
Oh, my God!

380
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:53,362
What the hell
happened to you?

381
00:12:53,395 --> 00:12:55,295
I'm okay.
My capillaries burst.

382
00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:55,370
Your capillaries?

383
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,628
Your capillaries?

384
00:12:56,662 --> 00:12:58,028
Do you know
what you look like?

385
00:12:58,062 --> 00:12:59,028
How are you doing?

386
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:01,395
Having a good time.

387
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:04,062
Is it my imagination
or is it freezing in here?

388
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:05,795
What happened to your eyes?

389
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,462
Well, I started
to go under--

390
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,562
With the instructor?

391
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:10,695
Yeah, and I got
about 10 feet down

392
00:13:10,728 --> 00:13:13,462
and I felt this tremendous
pressure on my mask,

393
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:15,795
like my eyeballs were being
sucked out of their sockets.

394
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,095
I told you.

395
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:19,628
Excuse me.

396
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:22,728
Doris would like to borrow
your red pocketbook

397
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:24,862
to go with her shoes.

398
00:13:24,895 --> 00:13:25,370
The shoes
have to match the pocketbook.

399
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,462
The shoes
have to match the pocketbook.

400
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:27,828
What's she doing, yoga?

401
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:31,128
My back hurts.

402
00:13:31,162 --> 00:13:32,695
Morty, better hurry up.
Get ready.

403
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,228
We've got
plenty of time.

404
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:35,295
What happened to you?

405
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:37,028
I got in a fist fight

406
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:39,728
with one of
the ladies at the pool.

407
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:41,128
It's from scuba diving.

408
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:42,962
What's there
to see underwater?

409
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:45,295
Uh, listen, Mr. Clompers,

410
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:47,862
it was really a nice gesture
of you to give me the pen,

411
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,395
but I don't really need it.

412
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:50,795
You what?

413
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:52,395
No, I mean,
it's a terrific pen,

414
00:13:52,428 --> 00:13:54,195
but I think you should keep it.

415
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:55,370
Well, I mean--

416
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:55,462
Well, I mean--

417
00:13:55,495 --> 00:13:56,628
Take it.

418
00:13:56,662 --> 00:13:58,862
All right.

419
00:13:58,895 --> 00:14:00,128
You know, Jack,

420
00:14:00,162 --> 00:14:02,195
you've got nerve,
taking that kid's pen.

421
00:14:02,228 --> 00:14:03,195
Whose pen?

422
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:04,228
His pen.

423
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:05,695
This happens to be my pen.

424
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:07,128
Oh, you didn't give it to him?

425
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:10,362
What are you talking about?
He practically begged me for it.

426
00:14:10,395 --> 00:14:13,028
Where do you come up
with this crap?

427
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:14,195
Listen, do you think

428
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,862

everybody offers me?

429
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:17,862
You offered me
sponge cake yesterday.

430
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:18,862
Did I take it?

431
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:20,462
You said you didn't want it.

432
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:21,462
Of course,
I wanted it.

433
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:23,462
I love sponge cake!

said you couldn't have it?

said you couldn't have it?

What do I care whether
you have a piece of sponge cake.

437

when I took the scotch tape!

Oh-ho!
So you got the scotch tape!

439

all over for it.

do me a favor, will you?

and get the hell out of here!

to this behavior?

Is it the humidity,
is it the Muzak,

00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:09,628
is it the white shoes?

454

for either one of them.

00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:41,795
Dad!

536
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:44,628
He gave my son a pen
and then he takes it back.

537
00:18:44,662 --> 00:18:45,628
Tell them about that!

538
00:18:45,662 --> 00:18:46,628
I took it back?

539
00:18:46,662 --> 00:18:47,962
He gave it to me!

540
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:49,128
Come on, that's enough.
Sit down.

541
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,195
I'm not finished.

542
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:51,862
Give me that microphone.
Give it to me!

543
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:53,295
Morty, give me that back!

544
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:54,295
Where's the pen?

545
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:55,370
Ow!

546
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,795
Ow!

547
00:18:56,828 --> 00:18:58,395
You broke my dental plate.

548
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,228
Doris, he broke
my dental plate!

549
00:19:01,262 --> 00:19:03,362
You son-of-a-bitch.
I'm gonna sue you.

550
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:04,962
Jerry, do your act.

551
00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:07,062
I can't.
Nobody's even listening.

552
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:08,728
They're all going to leave.

553
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:11,795
Oh, God.

554
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:12,795
How you folks
doing tonight?

555
00:19:12,828 --> 00:19:14,062
MAN: Who are you?

556
00:19:14,095 --> 00:19:16,062
Hey, have you ever noticed
how they give you always

557
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,728
give you the peanuts
on the planes?

558
00:19:17,762 --> 00:19:19,362
WOMAN: Not my Harry.
He flies first class.

559
00:19:19,395 --> 00:19:20,962
Who would've thought
that the number one thing

560
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:22,695
everybody wants on a plane
is a peanut.

561
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,295
MAN: I'd rather have
a bottle of scotch!

562
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:25,370
Do the dog routine.

563
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,628
Do the dog routine.

564
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:30,662
All I said was
I liked the pen!

565
00:19:32,762 --> 00:19:35,228
Stella!

566
00:19:36,662 --> 00:19:39,128
DOCTOR:
You could aggravate it.

567
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:41,862
I wouldn't go anywhere
for at least five days.

568
00:19:41,895 --> 00:19:44,128
Five days?

569
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:46,795
You want me to stay here
for five more days?

570
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:48,795
There must be some mistake.

571
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:51,195
I'm afraid not.

572
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:53,128
Five days. Here.

573
00:19:53,162 --> 00:19:55,370
So we have you
for five more days.

574
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,128
So we have you
for five more days.

575
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,728
Well, there's really
no point in me staying.

576
00:19:58,762 --> 00:19:59,962
I mean,
you're just gonna be--

577
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:00,962
Excuse me?

578
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:02,862
Nothing.

579
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:04,395
[KNOCKING]

580
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:06,195
Good morning.

581
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:07,728
Hi, Evelyn.

582
00:20:07,762 --> 00:20:11,295
Has Morty decided
on a lawyer yet?

583
00:20:11,328 --> 00:20:12,362
I don't think so.

584
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:14,695
Because my nephew Larry
could do it.

585
00:20:14,728 --> 00:20:18,228
He's a brilliant lawyer.
He says Jack has no case.

586
00:20:18,262 --> 00:20:20,795
Well, I'll ask him
when he gets up.

587
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:22,562
Oh, and I spoke
to Arnold,

588
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:25,370
and he says that
according to the bylaws

589
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:25,795
and he says that
according to the bylaws

590
00:20:25,828 --> 00:20:27,862
of the condo constitution,

591
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,295
they need six votes

592
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,062
to throw you out
for unruly behavior.

593
00:20:32,095 --> 00:20:34,195
Not five.

594
00:20:34,228 --> 00:20:37,195
Dr. Chernov is the one
you'll have to suck up to.

595
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:38,795
DAD: Oh.

596
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:40,362
Oh.

597
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:43,462
Oh, my back.

598
00:20:43,495 --> 00:20:45,462
Oh, my back!

599
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,728
It's that bar.

600
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:48,462
Who could hell could sleep
on that thing?

601
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:50,795
I was very comfortable.

602
00:20:50,828 --> 00:20:53,395
Morty, Arnold says
they need six votes

603
00:20:53,428 --> 00:20:54,795
to throw you out.

604
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:55,370
It's in the constitution.

605
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,395
It's in the constitution.

606
00:20:56,428 --> 00:20:58,362
Who are you?

607
00:20:58,395 --> 00:21:00,028
I'm a chiropractor.

608
00:21:00,062 --> 00:21:02,362
What, are you
kidding me?

609
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:04,728
Five more days?

610
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:06,895
Well, today's almost over,

611
00:21:06,928 --> 00:21:10,528
and weekdays always go by fast,

612
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:11,528
and Friday, we're leaving.

613
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:12,862
so it's like two days really.

614
00:21:12,895 --> 00:21:16,462
It's like
a cup of coffee.

615
00:21:16,495 --> 00:21:19,295
It'll go by like that.

616
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:21,962
Is Florida
not hot and muggy enough

617
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:22,962
for these people?

618
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:24,628
They love heat.

619
00:21:24,662 --> 00:21:25,370
If they try to land men
on the sun,

620
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,728
If they try to land men
on the sun,

621
00:21:27,762 --> 00:21:29,362
I think these old retired guys

622
00:21:29,395 --> 00:21:31,795
will be the only ones
that will be able to handle it.

623
00:21:31,828 --> 00:21:33,728
They'll just sit there
on the redwood benches,

624
00:21:33,762 --> 00:21:36,528
washcloth on their head,

625
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,228
going,
"Trying to get a sweat going."

626
00:21:39,995 --> 00:21:41,495
