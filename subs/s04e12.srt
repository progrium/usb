1
00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:03,800
Have you noticed that everything
on planes is very tiny?

2
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:05,400
There's always tiny food,
tiny liquor bottles,

3
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:08,733
tiny pillows, tiny bathroom,
tiny sink, tiny soap?

4
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:12,566
Everyone's in a cramped seat
working on a tiny computer.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,700
There's always
"a small problem."

6
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:15,000
"There'll be a slight delay."
"You'll be a bit late."

7
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:17,333
"If you could be
a little patient!"

8
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:19,333
"We're just trying to get
one of those little trucks

9
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:22,066
"to pull us up
a little closer to the Jetway

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,033
"so you can walk down
the narrow hallway.

11
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,366
"There'll be a man there
in a tight suit,

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,566
"and he'll tell you

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,700
"you have very little time
to make your connecting flight.

14
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:30,000
So move it!"

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,900
So move it!"

00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:38,200

♪ Bah, bah, bah Bah, bah ♪

17
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:39,966

00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,800
Hey, could you
do me a favor? Huh?

21
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,366
Could you shut up?
[LAUGHS]

22
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,533
And open the window,
please.

23
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:48,700
It's very hot in here.

24
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:50,200
You're wearing
that heavy jacket.

25
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:52,333
All right, fine, I'll take
it off. Grab the wheel.

26
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:53,966
No, Jerry, I don't
want to do that.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,133
Come on, just do it.

28
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,333
No, I don't like to do this.
Elaine, just get it.

29
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:58,633
Jer--
My hand is stuck.

30
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,033
Okay, don't
fool around.

31
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:01,200
My hand! My hand!

32
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:02,241
Don't, Jer--
All right, fine.

33
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:02,366
Don't, Jer--
All right, fine.

34
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,800
Ah! Elaine.

35
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,800
Hey, guess what.
This window doesn't work.

36
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,633
I hate rental cars.
Nothing ever works.

37
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,633
Window doesn't work,
radio doesn't work,

38
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,633
and it smells
like a cheap hooker.

39
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,500
Or is that you?

40
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,666
Gimme 10 bucks
and find out.

41
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,800
So this worked out
pretty good.

42
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,966
Them giving me
an extra ticket, you know?

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,966
You get a free trip
to St. Louis.

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,966
I did my gig. You got
to see your sister.

45
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
Yeah,
worked out good.

46
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:29,200
And here's the beauty...

47
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:30,200
What?

48
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:31,833
George is picking us up
at the airport.

49
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:32,241
Get outta here. Why?
Yep.

50
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:33,033
Get outta here. Why?
Yep.

51
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:36,200
You know that awning
outside my building? Yeah.

52
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:38,000
He's always bragging
about his vertical leap,

53
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:39,500
so I bet him 50 bucks

54
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,300
that he couldn't touch
the awning.

55
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,800
So, what happened?

56
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,200
[CHUCKLES]
He didn't come within 2 feet of the thing.

57
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:47,466
[LAUGHING]
He's waving at it.

58
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,466
So I told him

59
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,133
if he picks us up
at the airport,

60
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,300
he wouldn't
have to pay me.

61
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,366
Hey, how we doing
on time?

62
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,633
Timed out perfectly.

63
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:57,033
Drop off the car,
pick up the rental-car shuttle,

64
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:58,333
we walk right on the plane.

65
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:02,241
Wait up!
Wait up!

66
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:03,366
Wait up!
Wait up!

67
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,633
Sorry.

68
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,166
Wait! Wait!

69
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,300
MAN: See you later.
MAN 2: See you.

70
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,300
Where you going?

71
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,966
Uh, JFK.

72
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,966
I need some small bills
for a tip.

73
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,800
You got anything?
Yeah. You want a 5?

74
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,000
Uh, gimme a 10.

75
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:20,466
You're giving him $10?

76
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Well, we got
three bags.

77
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:22,533
That's a pretty big tip.

78
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:23,633
That's what they get.

79
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,133
They don't get
that much.

80
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,133
Let's ask him.

81
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,300
You can't ask him.

82
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,633
Let's see
what he says.

83
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,133
Jerry, we don't
have time for this.

84
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,133
Two seconds.

85
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,241
Excuse me.

86
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:32,633
Excuse me.

87
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,800
My friend and I here
were having a discussion.

88
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:35,966
We were just
kind of wondering

89
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,633
what you usually get
for a tip.

90
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,200
Depends on the person,
depends on the bag.

91
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:41,200
Well, how about
a couple people like us?

92
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:42,800
Two people like you?
I wouldn't expect much.

93
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,800
You don't even look like
you know what you're doing.

94
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,633
Come on, seriously.

95
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,466
Well, since you asked...

96
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,800
usually I get $5 a bag.

97
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:52,833
What?

98
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:53,966
That's right.

99
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,466
Five dollars a bag?

100
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,633
I don't think so.

101
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,133
Look, you asked, I told you.

102
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,533
You've got some nerve

103
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:00,800
trying to
take advantage of us.

104
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,833
All right, look,
we're late.

105
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:02,241
Thank you very much.

106
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:03,966
Thank you very much.

107
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,300
You're lucky I don't report you.

108
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,333
Come on.

109
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,133
JFK...

110
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,400
Honolulu.

111
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,866
Wait up!

112
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,866
See, never be late
for a plane with a girl.

113
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,633
Because a girl
runs like a girl,

114
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,633
with the little steps

115
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,333
and the arms
flailing out.

116
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:24,800
You wanna
make this plane?

117
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,200
You gotta run like a man!

118
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:28,033
Get your knees up!

119
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,241

The flight's been canceled?

120
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:32,333
BOTH:
The flight's been canceled?

121
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:33,666
Everything into JFK
is booked.

122
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,133
[BOTH GROANS]

123
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,333
No, wait, I have two seats
into LaGuardia,

124
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:38,333
but they're not together.

125
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:39,633
It's boarding right now.

126
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,533
We'll take them.
We're not gonna sit together?

127
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:43,500
So what? It's not
that long. You'll read.

128
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:44,633
Well, what about
George?

129
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,300
He's supposed to
pick us up at Kennedy.

130
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,533
We'll call him.
There's no time.

131
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:48,533
No time.
Is there time?

132
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:49,866
There's no time.
There's no time.

133
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,500
All right. We'll call him
from the plane.

134
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:54,000
I have one seat in first class,
and one in coach.

135
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,166
The price is the same

136
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,500
because
your flight was canceled.

137
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:57,533
Oh.
Oh.

138
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:59,666
Well, uh...
Um...

139
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,633
I'll take
the first class.

What?

141
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:02,833
Jerry.
What?

142
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:04,833
Why should you
get the first class?

143
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:07,000
Elaine, have you ever flown
first class?

144
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:08,000
No.

145
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:09,333
All right, then.

00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:10,866
See, you won't know
what you're missing.

I've flown first class, Elaine.

148
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,666
I can't go back to coach.
I can't. I won't.

149
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,666
You flew here coach.

150
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, that's a point.

151
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:20,000
All right, fine.
I don't care.

152
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,133
If the plane crashes,

153
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,133
everybody in first class
is gonna die anyway.

00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,500

you'll live.

in the baggage area.
