1
00:00:01,433 --> 00:00:03,200
So I was in the drugstore
the other day,

2
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:04,400
trying to get a cold medication.

3
00:00:04,433 --> 00:00:06,400
Did you ever try
and pick one of these out?

4
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:08,400
It's a wall, it's an entire wall
of cold medications.

5
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:09,800
You're standing there,
you're going, "All right.

6
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:13,233
"All right, all right.
Okay, what the hell am I--?

7
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:17,033
"This is quick-acting,
but this is long-lasting.

8
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:21,500
When do I need to feel good?
Now or later?"

9
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:22,666
It's a tough question.

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,466
And then we show you
the commercials on TV,

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,666
where they show you what's wrong
with the guy, you know,

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,066
and they always show you, like,
all the problems that he has.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,000
First of all, they always
show you the human body,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,066
First of all, they always
show you the human body,

15
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,400
which is usually this guy:

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,900
No face, mouth open.

17
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:38,033
This is how drug companies
see the public.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,233
And he's always
in, like, a certain pain.

19
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:45,066
It's like red, wavy lines
are going through him, you know,

20
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,400
or he's glowing,

21
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:48,800
parts of him are on fire
sometimes,

22
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,633
lightning is attacking him...

23
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,633
I never had a doctor say to me,

24
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,233
"Are you having pain?"
"Yes, I am."

25
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:56,366
"Are you having any lightning
with the pain?"

26
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,366
How did you get fleas?

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,966
Because my cousin's imbecile dog
was rolling around outside,

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,400
and they got in his carpet.

29
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:14,666
Maybe you could get yourself
a little bow tie flea collar.

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,866
That's real funny.

31
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,366
So are you coming to the party?

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,733
Um... I'd go,

33
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:22,466
but Long Island,
it's so far out.

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,866
It smacks
of desperation.

35
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,866
The whole party, everyone's
gonna be saying to me,

36
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,000
"You came all the way out
from Manhattan for this?"

37
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:28,642
You know,
Ava's gonna be there.

38
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:29,566
You know,
Ava's gonna be there.

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,566
Who?

40
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,466
The nice one
that works in my office.

41
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,033
Eh...
I'll drive.

42
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:36,166
Oh, well,
now you're talking.

43
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,666
It's supposed
to be a good party.

44
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,133
Well, what does
that mean?

45
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,333
Good dip?

46
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:43,000
No. There'll be girls there.

47
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:44,700
There's girls everywhere.

48
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:46,133
I go out of
my apartment,

49
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,400
there's girls
in the elevator.

50
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:50,466
They're in cafeterias,
subways. So what?

51
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,366
There's a hundred
different things here.

52
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:55,700
What's the difference
between these two?

53
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:58,500
You got propylparaben?

54
00:01:58,533 --> 00:01:58,642
Got it.

55
00:01:58,642 --> 00:01:59,500
Got it.

56
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:00,633
You got isobutane 30?

57
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,566
I've got isobutane 20.

58
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,066
A-ha.

59
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,900
You got sorbitan sesquioleate?

60
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:07,900
Got it.

61
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:08,900
I have aloe.

62
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,233
You got aloe? I love aloe.

63
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,300
Where do they make yours?

64
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,566
Jersey.
White Plains.

65
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Pfft.

66
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,533
JERRY:
Girls...

67
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:20,033
There's girls
right here in the store.

68
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:23,133
Look, look,
there's one over there.

69
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,800
Look.

70
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,233
There's another one.

71
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:28,642
As soon as I walk outside,
there'll be girls out there.

72
00:02:28,642 --> 00:02:29,133
As soon as I walk outside,
there'll be girls out there.

73
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,066
What's the matter?

74
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,400
I gave her a 20.

75
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:34,200
She only gave me
change for a 10.

76
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,200
Are you sure?

77
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:36,700
Oh, boy, here we go.

78
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,566
Excuse me. Um,
I gave you a $20 bill,

79
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,566
and you only actually gave me
change for a 10.

80
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,900
You gave me a 10.

81
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,566
I'm positive I gave you a 20.

82
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,400
I know what you gave me.

83
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,966
You owe me $10.

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
Will you please step aside.

85
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:51,233
Next!
All right.

86
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:53,000
All right, let's... Let's just
examine the situation

87
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:54,033
for a second.

88
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:56,166
Who in this situation

89
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,733
would be more likely
to make a mistake?

90
00:02:57,766 --> 00:02:58,642
Me, who had access to my wallet,
knew exactly what was in there,

91
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:01,833
Me, who had access to my wallet,
knew exactly what was in there,

92
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:02,833
or you?

93
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:03,833
You.

94
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:05,533
No, no, no.

95
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:06,900
See, you're not
really listening.

96
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,066
What's the problem
here?

97
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,300
No problem.
There's no problem.

98
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,700
She just owes me $10,
that's all.

99
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:11,900
Oh, he's claiming short.

100
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:13,733
All right, let's just
take it outside.

101
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:16,200
Oh, so you don't
believe me either?

102
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:17,866
Come on, let's go.

103
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,233
You haven't won.

104
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,033
You may think you've won,
but you haven't won.

105
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,533
Do you know why?
It's not over.

106
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:23,833
This is not over.

107
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm not forgetting
what's happening here.

108
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,066
You have my $10.

109
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,566
I will get it back.

110
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:28,642
All right.

111
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:29,866
All right.

112
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,166
Don't worry.
It's not over.

113
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,166
I'm going now.

114
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,433
Goodbye. I will be back.
Ho-ho-ho!

[SOFT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]

116
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:44,400
ELAINE: Well,
don't stand here.

117
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,233
Let's walk in.
Blend in, blend in.

118
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:48,633
No, let's survey first,

119

Ava.

120
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,533
What could possess anyone
to throw a party?

121
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:56,133
I mean,
to have a bunch of strangers

122
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,300
treat your house
like a hotel room?

123
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:58,642
So guess who just sold
129 West 81st?

124
00:03:58,642 --> 00:04:01,900
So guess who just sold
129 West 81st?

125
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:02,900
Oh, no, you didn't.

GEORGE:
Get out! When?

127
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,666
Yesterday.

128
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,666
I don't believe it.
Ask Mark.

129
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,666
Mark, is this true?

130
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,100
Oh!

131
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:18,033
Yeah, this has got disaster
written all over it.

132
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:20,666
How did I ever let you
talk me into this?

133
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,666
I must have been
out of my mind.

134
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,233
Now, listen, let's keep
an eye on each other tonight.

135
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,733
In case one of us
gets in a bad conversation,

136
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:28,642
we should have a signal
that you're in trouble

137
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:29,566
we should have a signal
that you're in trouble

138
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,566
so the other one
can get us out of it.

139
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,066
How old are you?

140
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,333
Thirty-six.

141
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:36,366
What's the signal?

142
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,466
How about this?

143
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,900
Chicken wing.

144
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:44,500
No, no, no,
I've got a better one.

Head-patting.

146
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:48,433
Whatever you want.

147
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:55,066
You came all the way out
from Manhattan for this?

148
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,900
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

149
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:58,642
So, what do you do?

150
00:04:58,642 --> 00:04:59,700
So, what do you do?

151
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,400
I'm a comedian.

152
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:06,733
Are you?

153
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:08,133
Let me ask you
something.

154
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,333
Where do you get
your material?

155
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:10,666
I hear a voice.

156
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,233
What kind of voice?

157
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:14,800
A man's voice,
but he speaks in German,

158
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,366
so I have to get it translated.

159
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:19,333
How come you keep tapping
your head?

160
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:21,633
Uh, it's a nervous tic.

161
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,300
I'm on L-dopa.

162
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,833
On the other hand,

163
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,566
you take a guy
like George Washington Carver.

164
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,642
The man devoted his whole life
to the peanut.

165
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:31,300
The man devoted his whole life
to the peanut.

166
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,266
Imagine having so much passion
for something.

167
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:38,666
You know, people tell me
I'm a funny guy.

168
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,666
I've often wondered

169
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,600
if he ever worked
with the pecan.

170
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,400
Yeah, me too.

171
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:49,233
Now, is that considered a nut?

172
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,666
Because I know
the cashew is a legume.

173
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,566
How's it going?

174
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,733
Great.
How about you?

175
00:05:57,766 --> 00:05:58,642
I can't believe
what's happening here.

176
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:00,166
I can't believe
what's happening here.

177
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,700
She hasn't taken her hands
off me all night.

178
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,500
I mean, she was always friendly
around the office,

179
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:05,500
but that was it.

180
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,200
How do you account for this?

181
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,200
I don't know.

182
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,000
Maybe a safe fell on her head.

183
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:13,066
Well, she obviously
liked you all along.

184
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,666
No, I would have
picked up on it.

185
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,466
I can always tell
when a woman likes me.

186
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,366
They always somehow
let you know.

187
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,366
With me, they could torture me,
I wouldn't tell them.

188
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,966
If anything,
I try to make them think

189
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,066
I don't like them.

190
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,700
Then they think,
"Oh, look at this guy.

191
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:25,966
"He's not even looking at me.

192
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,400
He must have something
going for him," you know.

193
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:28,642
Anyway,
I'm ready to go.

194
00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:29,866
Anyway,
I'm ready to go.

195
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,866
Now?

196
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,700
Well, if not now, when?

197
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,666
Give me a half-hour.

198
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,400
Okay, half-hour.

199
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:39,400
Peanut brittle,
peanut butter,

200
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:40,566
peanut oil...

201
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,633
Can I talk to you
for a second?

202
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,933
Oh, excuse me.

203
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:47,333
What have you been doing?

204
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,666
I've been smacking myself
senseless.

205
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:52,866
People think
I'm a mental patient.

206
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,000
Hey, I was dying over there.

207
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:57,566
This guy's going off
on the peanut.

208
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,642
Now, pay attention.

209
00:06:58,642 --> 00:06:59,466
Now, pay attention.

210
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,066
Yeah, I think I've seen you
in a club.

211
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,066
You talk about
a lot of everyday things, right?

212
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,066
Right.

213
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,900
Yeah. I remember you.

214
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,400
I wonder what happened
to my fiancé.

215
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:13,400
I know he's here
somewhere.

216
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,633
Ellen,

217
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,633
have you seen
my fiancé?

218
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,633
He's upstairs.

219
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:18,733
Are you going
upstairs?

220
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:21,566
Tell my fiancé
I'm looking for him.

221
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,666
I have lost my fiancé,
the poor baby.

222
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:28,642
[AUSTRALIAN ACCENT]
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.

223
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:30,333
[AUSTRALIAN ACCENT]
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.

224
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:34,733
What?

225
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:38,066
The dingo ate your baby.

226
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,200
You ready?

227
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:50,233
Listen,

228
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:52,233
I have a tremendous favor
to ask.

229
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:53,566
I do favors.

230
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,666
I think something's
happening here.

231
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,733
What?

232
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:58,642
I think she wants me
to take her home.

233
00:07:58,642 --> 00:07:59,066
I think she wants me
to take her home.

234
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,700
Wow.

235
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:01,966
What should I do?

236
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,233
Go. What can you do?

237
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:05,800
What about you
and Elaine?

238
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,666
We'll get a ride.
Are you sure?

239
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,200
We'll be fine.
What did she say?

240
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:11,033
She told me she wants--

241
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:15,433
She told me she wants me
to make love to her.

242
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:18,800
What? She said that?

243
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,133
Yeah.

244
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,466
Get out of here.

245
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,266
I swear.

246
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:25,733
What did you say?

247
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:26,966
I--

248
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,066
Oh, I-- I can't.

249
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,642
Come on, what did you say?

250
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:29,700
Come on, what did you say?

251
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:30,900
Please, it's-- It's...

252
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:31,900
What?

253
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:35,033
"I..."

254
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,166
"I, uh..."

255
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:43,533
"I long for you."

256
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:44,666
"I long for you"?

257
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,333
I was so shocked.
I was lucky I said anything.

258
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:49,400
It's okay. That's not bad.

259
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:51,733
I don't like when a woman
says "Make love to me."

260
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:53,033
It's intimidating.

261
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,833
The last time
a woman said that to me,

262
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:56,733
I wound up apologizing to her.

263
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:58,033
Really?

264
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:58,642
That's a lot of pressure.
"Make love to me."

265
00:08:58,642 --> 00:09:00,700
That's a lot of pressure.
"Make love to me."

266
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,900
What am I? In a circus?

267
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:04,200
What if I can't deliver?

268
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:05,566
Oh, come on.

269
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,866
I can't perform
under pressure.

270
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,066
That's why I never play
anything for money.

271
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,966
I choke.

272
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,733
I could choke tonight.

273
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:14,233
And she works in my office.

274
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:16,066
Can you imagine?
If she goes around

275
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,466
telling everyone
what happened?

276
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,800
Oh, maybe I should cancel.

277
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,400
I have a very bad
feeling about this.

278
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:21,900
George,
you're thinking too much.

279
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:25,066
I know, I know.
I can't stop it.

280
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,633
Well, right now,

281
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,833
I'm reading manuscripts
for Pendant Publishing.

282
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:32,000
JERRY:
Pendant?

283
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,666
Those bastards.

284
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,733
Excuse me.

285
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,500
Listen, George is going home
with this Ava from his office.

286
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:43,133
Really?

287
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,033
Huh. What a world.

288
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:47,400
So we can go now.

289
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:49,366
No, he's taking the car.

290
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,900
Well, what are we going
to do for a ride?

291
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't know.

292
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:55,833
You don't know?

293
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:57,733
Maybe Kramer
can come pick us up.

294
00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:58,642
Oh, great. Oh, this is great.

295
00:09:58,642 --> 00:10:00,700
Oh, great. Oh, this is great.

296
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,366
How could you let him
take the car?

297
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,933
There's nothing I could do.
It's part of the code.

298
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:10,133
All plans between men
are tentative.

299
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,466
If one man should suddenly have
an opportunity

300
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,800
to pursue a woman,

301
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,966
it's like these two guys
never met each other

302
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,233
ever in life.

303
00:10:17,266 --> 00:10:19,900
This is the male code.

304
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,133
And it doesn't matter

305
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,066
how important
the arrangements are.

306
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,400
I mean, most of the time,

307
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:25,900
they scrub
a space shuttle mission,

308
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:27,666
it's because one
of the astronauts met someone

309
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,642
on his way to the launch pad.

310
00:10:28,642 --> 00:10:29,800
on his way to the launch pad.

311
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,066
They hold that countdown.

312
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,233
He's leaning against the rocket,
talking to her,

313
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,466
"So listen,
when I get back,

314
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,433
what do you say we get together
for some Tang?"

315
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:39,733
ELAINE:
Oh, look at that.

316
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,866
Look at what she's wearing.
You see what she's wearing?

317
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,166
Yeah, yeah,
all right.

318
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,166
I can't believe
she's walking around in that.

319
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,666
Just don't make a scene.

320
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,733
Hey, is that real fur?
Oh, boy.

321
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:52,233
It'd better be, or my ex-husband
owes me an explanation.

322
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:53,233
Good night.

323
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:54,566
You don't care

324
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,233
that innocent, defenseless
animals are being tortured

325
00:10:56,266 --> 00:10:57,400
so that you can look good?

326
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:58,642
Could we talk about this
some other time?

327
00:10:58,642 --> 00:10:59,500
Could we talk about this
some other time?

328
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,733
Are you a vegetarian?

329
00:11:00,766 --> 00:11:01,900
Here we go.

330
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:04,066
Yeah, yeah.
I eat fish occasionally.

331
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,533
So you're a hypocrite.

332
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:08,733
Hey, I've eaten frogs,
so nobody's perfect.

333
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:09,866
Anyway, we...

334
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,666
Well, talk to me
when you stop eating fish.

335
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,233
Fish don't feel any pain.

336
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:15,400
How do you know?
Do you communicate with fish?

337
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,500
Well, they're not kept
in little cages.

338
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:18,500
Ever seen a goldfish?

339
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:19,900
Goldfish...

340
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah, I've seen goldfish.
They're not unhappy.

341
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:25,400
Swim around a bowl for two weeks
and get flushed down the toilet.

342
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:26,566
That's a good life.
Come on.

343
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,233
Oh, yeah, that's right.

344
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:28,642
Go ahead, go ahead.

345
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:29,466
Go ahead, go ahead.

346
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,900
Maybe you can run
over a squirrel!

347
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:32,233
Yeah, well,

348
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:34,566
that's why we're here
in America.

349
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,966
You're beautiful.

350
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,666
Call Kramer.

351
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,500
All right.

352
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,900
Excuse me.

353
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,400
This is your party,
right?

354
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:43,800
