Why can't I just walk up

that the good ones
know they're good.

And they know
they're in such demand,

00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:18,066
[GIGGLES]
What if it worked out?

178
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,366
Yeah, right.

179
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,733
GEORGE:
Out of the question.

180
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,333
Out of the question.

181
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:27,833
Why?
No.

182
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,900
I'm not gonna do that.

183
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:33,200
It's one step away
from personal ads.

184
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:34,800
Then prostitutes.

185
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,966
No! No!

186
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,400
I am not going
down that road.

187
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:45,100
What does
she look like?

188
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:49,033
She's good-looking.
How good-looking?

189
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:50,633
Very good-looking.
Really good-looking?

190
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,866
Really very good-looking.

191
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,733
Would you take her out?

192
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:54,966
Yes, I would
take her out.

193
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,033
Oh, you hesitated.

194
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,866
What hesitate?
I didn't hesitate.

195
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,333
Something's up here.
You hesitated.

196
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:02,566
I'm telling you,
she's good-looking.

197
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,200
What about the body?
What kind of body.

198
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:05,300
Good body. Nice body.

199
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,300
How nice?
Nice.

200
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,400
Just nice?
Pretty nice.

201
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:08,400
Really good?

202
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:10,900
Really very nice
and good.

203
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:18,400
What about personality?
Good personality.

204
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,800
Funny.

205
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,066
Bright.
Smarter than me?

206
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,566
I don't want anyone
smarter than me.

207
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,666
How could she be
smarter than you?

208
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,733
All right, let's see.
Let's see. What else?

209
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:35,233
What else?

210
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:37,333
Oh, yeah.
What does she do?

211
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:38,400
First of all...

212
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:39,466
what does he do?

213
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,333
He was
in real estate.

214
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:43,001
Um, now, he's not working
right now--

215
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:43,833
Um, now, he's not working
right now--

216
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:44,900
Oh! He's not working?
No.

217
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:46,500
No. No. No.

218
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,500
How come he's
not working?

219
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:49,566
Well-- Well,
I mean,

220
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,466
[LAUGHS]
he got fired.

221
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,833
Why did he get fired?

222
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:54,766
W-- Uh...

223
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:58,466
Oh, right.

224
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,200
Um, well, he...

225
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:03,200
He tried to...

226
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,466
poison his boss.

227
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,866
Excuse me?

228
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,666
It's such a long story,
Cynthia.

229
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,966
Seriously, I mean, he just had
some problems at work.

230
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,001
Is he nuts?
No!

231
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:13,400
Is he nuts?
No!

232
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:16,866
No, no. He's a really,
really funny guy.

233
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,966
[LAUGHS]

234
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,066
What does he look like?

235
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:20,733
Pardon?

236
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,000
What does he look like?

237
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:26,466
Um... Well, he's got a lot of
character in his face.

238
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,333
Um, he's short.

239
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:30,133
Um, he's stocky.

240
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,633
He's fat.

241
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,566
Is that what you're saying,
that he fat?

242
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,133
Powerful.

243
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,800
He is so powerful.

244
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:41,400
He can lift 100 pounds
right up over his head.

245
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:42,566
And, um...

246
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,001
What else?
What else?

247
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:43,833
What else?
What else?

248
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:45,466
Oh, r-- Um

249
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,533
Right, well...

250
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:48,200
Yeah, he's--
He's kind of--

251
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,066
Just kind of, unh,

252
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,066
losing his hair.

253
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,533
He's bald?

254
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,233
No!

255
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,900
No, no, no.

256
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,500
He's not bald.

257
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:59,533
He's balding.

258
00:08:59,566 --> 00:09:01,133
So he will be bald?

259
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,100
Yeah.

260
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:04,733
What kind of hair?

261
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:06,500
You know,
long, dark hair.

262
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:08,066
Flowing?

263
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,966
Flowing?

264
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,533
Is it flowing?

265
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:13,001
I like flowing,
cascading hair.

266
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:15,166
I like flowing,
cascading hair.

267
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,666
Thick, lustrous hair is
very important to me.

268
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,666
"Thick, lustrous hair
is very important to me,"

269
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,233
Is that what you said?
Yeah, that's right.

270
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:29,933
Just clarifying.

271
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:32,866
Let me ask you this.

272
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:40,133
If you stick your hand
in the hair...

273
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,933
is it easy
to get it out?

274
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,233
Do you wanna be able
to get it out?

275
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:49,733
Or do you wanna not be able
to get it out?

276
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:51,566
I'd like to be able
to get it out.

277
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,233
I think
you'll get it out.

278
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:55,733
What about the skin?

279
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:58,700
I need a good cheek.
I like a good cheek.

280
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,700
She's got a fine cheek.

281
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,400
Is there a pinkish hue?

282
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:06,833
A pinkish hue?

283
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:09,500
Yes, a--
A rosy glow.

284
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:11,866
There's a hue.

285
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,333
She's got
great eyebrows.

286
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:16,533
Women kill to have
her eyebrows.

287
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,266
Who cares
about eyebrows?

288
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:24,400
Is she sweet?

289
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:26,000
I like sweet.

290
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:28,833
But not too sweet.
You could throw up from that.

291
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,366
I don't think
you'll throw up.

292
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:38,000
She likes to throw up.

293
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:45,900
Has he ever been married?

294
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,000
No.

295
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,933
Has he been close?

296
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,000
He once spent a weekend
with a woman.

297
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,300
He didn't really try
to poison his boss.

298
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,166
Yeah, he did.

299
00:11:06,254 --> 00:11:08,387
GEORGE:
We had an incredible
phone conversation.

300
00:11:08,421 --> 00:11:10,254
We talked for
like 20 minutes.

301
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:13,254
I threw away my notes
in the middle of the call.

302
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:18,221
You know, I thought she had
a great voice timbre.

303
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:19,821
Is it "timbre"
or "tambre"?

304
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:20,887
I think it's tambre.

305
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:23,021
Huh. Why did I think
it was timbre?

306
00:11:23,054 --> 00:11:24,654
Yeah, she could do
voice-over commercials.

307
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:26,254
Why didn't you tell me
about her voice?

308
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:27,254
I didn't notice
the voice.

309
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,521
It's mellifluous.

310
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:32,354
So, Saturday night.

311
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:34,122
She had to be impressed
by that conversation. Had to.

312
00:11:34,122 --> 00:11:34,887
She had to be impressed
by that conversation. Had to.

313
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:37,821
It was a great performance.
I am unbelievable on the phone.

314
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:39,221
On the date,
they should just have

315
00:11:39,254 --> 00:11:41,254
two phones on the table
at the restaurant.

316
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:42,254
Done.

317
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:43,587
[LAUGHS]

318
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:46,487
Hi.
Hi!

319
00:11:46,521 --> 00:11:48,087
You know?
Saturday night.

320
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:49,521
I know.

321
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:50,854
So, what did she say?

322
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:53,087
She said you're getting
together Saturday night.

323
00:11:53,121 --> 00:11:54,454
Yeah.

324
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:56,421
That's it?

325
00:11:56,454 --> 00:11:57,854
Yeah.

326
00:11:57,887 --> 00:12:00,021
She didn't mention anything
about the conversation?

327
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,221
No.

328
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:04,122
Well, you see?
I don't get that.

329
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:05,887
Well, you see?
I don't get that.

330
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:08,421
What, we had a relaxed,
stimulating, great conversation.

331
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:10,221
She doesn't mention it?
Why doesn't she mention it?

332
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:11,487
What?
Well, she could've

333
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:13,554
mentioned the conversation.
All right. All right.

334
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:15,921
I'll go on the date,
but that's that.

335
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:18,987
Hey.

336
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:20,254
ALL: Hey.

337
00:12:21,421 --> 00:12:23,387
Do you know my friend
Bob Sakamano?

338
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:24,721
Oh, the guy
from Jersey.

339
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:27,754
Yeah, he just got a job
at a condom factory in Edison.

340
00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:30,554
Look at this.
He gave me a gross.

341
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:31,787
Look at that.

342
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,354
What are you gonna do
with all of them?

343
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:37,854
Oh, well.

344
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:45,087
Come on. Take some, Jerry.
Grab them.

345
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:48,054
No, thanks. They look like
they came out of a cereal box.

346
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:51,521
Hey, come on, Elaine,
here. Take half a bag.

347
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:52,521
Gotta, gotta.

348
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,887
Half a bag?

349
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:57,187
What am I, a hooker?

350
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:01,354
Anyway, they look
kind of cheap.

351
00:13:01,387 --> 00:13:02,421
Naw.

352
00:13:02,454 --> 00:13:04,122
I'll take one.

353
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:04,454
I'll take one.

354
00:13:06,554 --> 00:13:08,221
Yeah.

355
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,787
It's possible.

is still...

into the drug store,

It's a quarter to 12.

as soon as I'm done.

full disclosure.

All right, look,
I'm gonna tell you,

00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:08,987
but I made a pact
with Cynthia.

We swore we were not gonna
tell you and Elaine.

You can tell me. I'll vault it.
It's in the vault?

We had sex.

Oh, my God,
you had sex?

391
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:21,654
How did that happen?

I don't know.

393
00:14:22,787 --> 00:14:24,421
I closed my eyes
and made a move.

At your apartment?
Yeah.

She didn't stay over?
No. She left.

any of this to Elaine.

He was uncomfortable
because it was our first time.

401
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:41,254
So he felt he'd perform better
if we did it in the kitchen.

402
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:42,254
What?

403
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:43,421
Yeah, he says
the kitchen

404
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:45,321
is always the most sociable room
in the house.

405
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:47,021
And he was serious.

406
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,754

to say?

a good time.

with the waitress

relate to the commoners.

return phone calls.

531
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:14,587
I knew we shouldn't
have done it.

532
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:17,321
It was a bad idea
in the first place. I told you.

533
00:19:17,354 --> 00:19:19,987
You told me? You pushed
this whole thing on me.

534
00:19:20,021 --> 00:19:21,487
It was your idea.

535
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:24,254
I was just helping your
bitter, twisted friend.

536
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,754
She's not bitter.

537
00:19:25,787 --> 00:19:27,754
Well, bitter's a judgment call,
but she's twisted.

538
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:31,321
Twisted? God,
I did you a favor!

539
00:19:31,354 --> 00:19:32,821
You said they had
a good time.

540
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:34,122
Is there anything else
you're keeping from me?

541
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:34,387
Is there anything else
you're keeping from me?

542
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:35,554
Are you calling me
a liar?

543
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:36,921
I'm calling you one
if you are.

544
00:19:36,954 --> 00:19:38,021
You a liar?
Are you?

545
00:19:38,054 --> 00:19:39,421
Get your finger
out of my face.

546
00:19:39,454 --> 00:19:40,821
Get yours out.
I was here first.

547
00:19:40,854 --> 00:19:42,754
I don't care.
Get it out!

548
00:19:42,787 --> 00:19:44,421
Get it out!
Out! Out!

549
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:45,421
Hey, hey, hey!
All right.

550
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:47,187
Hey, hey! Come on,
stop it!

551
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:49,987
Come on. Break it up!

552
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:51,754
Hey, hey!

553
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:53,887
What's the matter
with you?

554
00:19:55,187 --> 00:19:57,387
Now, don't you two see...

555
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:59,754
that you're in love
with each other?

556
00:20:02,387 --> 00:20:04,122
I mean, why can't you
face that already?

557
00:20:04,122 --> 00:20:04,487
I mean, why can't you
face that already?

558
00:20:04,521 --> 00:20:05,754
You're running around
out there

559
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,254
looking for something
that's not even there

560
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:08,521
when everything
that you dream of

561
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:09,521
is right here

562
00:20:09,554 --> 00:20:10,987
right here
in front of you.

563
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:13,654
Now why can't you
admit that?

564
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:16,521
By the way, when you see George,
give him these. These'll work.

565
00:20:16,554 --> 00:20:18,354
[GASPS]

566
00:20:18,387 --> 00:20:21,687
I knew those condoms
were defective!

567
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,387
Oh.
How did you know

568
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:25,021
they were defective?!

569
00:20:25,054 --> 00:20:26,154
Because!

570
00:20:26,187 --> 00:20:29,054
Because she missed
her period!

571
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:32,254
She missed
her period?

572
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:38,021
Oh, my God!

573
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:40,321
I can't believe it.

574
00:20:40,354 --> 00:20:41,821
I'm a father!

575
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:42,821
I did it!

576
00:20:42,854 --> 00:20:44,554
My boys can swim!

577
00:20:44,587 --> 00:20:45,887
I can do it!

578
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:47,254
I can do it!

579
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,754
I'm a father!

580
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:54,921
CYNTHIA:
So he shows up.

581
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,854
He's all out of breath.
He's disheveled.

582
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:59,187
And he tells me
that no matter happens,

583
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:00,387
whatever I decide

584
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:01,854
is fine with him.
[GASPS]

585
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:03,354
And that I could
depend on him

586
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,122
and that he would
be there

587
00:21:04,122 --> 00:21:04,521
and that he would
be there

588
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,054
to support me
in whatever way I need.

589
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:10,221
Elaine, I was speechless.

590
00:21:10,254 --> 00:21:11,854
Wow. Wow.

591
00:21:11,887 --> 00:21:13,687
You see? You think
you know somebody.

592
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:16,221
I said to him,
"I really appreciate this, but

593
00:21:16,254 --> 00:21:17,554
I just got my period."

594
00:21:17,587 --> 00:21:19,387
Yeah.
And so I asked him to come in--

595
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:21,087
GEORGE:
Hi.
Oh, hi.

596
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:22,854
Sorry we're late.
We got so...

597
00:21:22,887 --> 00:21:26,187
hung up in traffic.
I'm sorry.

598
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:28,221
What happened?
Acting.

599
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:32,887
Very mature.
Thank you.

600
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,021
Hi, Cynthia.
Hi.

601
00:21:36,054 --> 00:21:38,554
Well, this is a great place
to sit you got here.

602
00:21:38,587 --> 00:21:40,087
It's the best seat
in the house.

603
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:41,154
Right next to
the kitchen.

604
00:21:41,187 --> 00:21:43,087
Oh, stop it. Stop it.

605
00:21:43,854 --> 00:21:45,687
[LAUGHS]

606
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,987
So, what are these?

607
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:48,821
Oh, we ordered appetizers.
Start eating.

608
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:50,654
Oh, fabulous.

609
00:21:50,687 --> 00:21:52,821
Mmm. Mm-mmm.

610
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:53,987
Mmmm.

611
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,954
This is good.
Oh, this is good.

612
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:59,754
Is that salt?
Is this salt on this?

613
00:21:59,787 --> 00:22:01,854
Is there salt on this?

614
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,887
But have you ever
fixed anybody up?

615
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:04,122
Why do we do it? Why?
WOMAN: Good time.

616
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,321
Why do we do it? Why?
WOMAN: Good time.

617
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:08,154
You thought
they would have a good time

618
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:09,821
and little power trips
for you, isn't it?

619
00:22:09,854 --> 00:22:10,987
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

620
00:22:11,021 --> 00:22:12,854
Now you're playing God.
Of course, God...

621
00:22:12,887 --> 00:22:15,654
was the first person
to fix people up.

622
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:17,721
He fixed up Adam and Eve,
you know?

623
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,754
I'm sure he said to Adam,
"No, she's nice.

624
00:22:19,787 --> 00:22:21,221
"She's, uh...

625
00:22:21,254 --> 00:22:22,921
"She's, uh...

626
00:22:22,954 --> 00:22:25,421
"Yes, she's very free
about her body.

627
00:22:25,454 --> 00:22:27,921
"Doesn't really wear much.

628
00:22:27,954 --> 00:22:31,454
She was going out with a snake.
I think that's over though."
