1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,677
Most men like working on things.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,347
Tools, objects, fixing things.
This is what men enjoy doing.

3
00:00:10,773 --> 00:00:14,105
Ever noticed if a guy's in his driveway
working on something with tools...

4
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,349
...how all the other men
in the neighbourhood...

5
00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:19,015
...are magnetically drawn
to this activity?

6
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:22,642
They just come wandering out
of the house like zombies.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,445
Men-- lt's true. Men hear a drill,
it's like a dog whistle. Just:

8
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,564
They go running up
to the living-room curtain.

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,356
'' Honey, l think Jim's working
on something over there.''

10
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:38,444
So they run over to the guy.

11
00:00:38,617 --> 00:00:40,324
They don't actually help the guy.

12
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:44,784
No. They just want to hang
around the area...

13
00:00:44,953 --> 00:00:48,320
...where work is being done.

14
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:52,325
That's what men want to do.

15
00:00:52,498 --> 00:00:54,785
We want to watch the guy.
We want to talk to him.

16
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:57,790
We want to ask him dumb questions.
You know....

17
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,032
''What are you using,
a Phillips head?''

18
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:05,332
You know, we feel involved.

19
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:07,624
That's why when they have
construction sites...

20
00:01:07,795 --> 00:01:10,202
...they have to have those wood
panel fences around it.

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,165
That's just to keep the men out.

22
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,998
They cut those little holes for us...

23
00:01:15,173 --> 00:01:17,793
...so we can see
what the hell is going on.

24
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:21,878
But if they don't cut those holes,
we are climbing those fences.

25
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:25,797
Right over there. ''What are you using,
the steel girders down here?''

26
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:29,424
Yeah, that'll hold.

27
00:01:42,309 --> 00:01:43,719
l had to say something.

28
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:45,846
Had to say something.

29
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:48,769
Everything was going so well.
l had to say something.

30
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:50,560
l don't think you did
anything wrong.

31
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,309
l told her l liked her. Why?

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,021
Why did l tell her l like her?

33
00:01:56,856 --> 00:02:00,472
l have this sick compulsion
to tell women how l feel.

34
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:02,392
l like you. l don't tell you.

35
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:04,605
We can only thank God for that.

36
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:08,935
l'm out of the picture.
l am out of the picture.

37
00:02:09,444 --> 00:02:11,352
Matter of time now.

38
00:02:11,528 --> 00:02:15,571
-You're imagining this. Really.
-Oh, no. No, no.

39
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:20,444
l'll tell you when it happened too.

40
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:24,563
lt's when that floss came
flying out of my pocket.

41
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:26,780
What floss? When?

42
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:29,073
ln the lobby, during
the intermission of the play.

43
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:31,780
l was buying her one of those
containers of orange drink.

44
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:33,826
For $5.

45
00:02:33,996 --> 00:02:35,904
l reach into my pocket
to pay for it. l look down.

46
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,949
There's this piece of green floss
hanging from my fingers.

47
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:41,873
-Mint.
-Of course.

48
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,332
So l'm looking at it.
l look up and see she's looking at it.

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,291
Our eyes lock.

50
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,624
lt was a horrible moment. l just....

51
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:57,329
So let me get this straight.
She saw the floss.

52
00:02:57,505 --> 00:03:00,587
You panicked, and you told her
you liked her.

53
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:02,415
lf l didn't put floss in my pocket...

54
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,716
...l'd be crawling around her bedroom
right now, looking for my glasses.

55
00:03:06,883 --> 00:03:11,009
-You sure the floss was the catalyst?
-Yes, l am.

56
00:03:11,177 --> 00:03:14,295
You don't think it might have
had anything to do with that?

57
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,712
What, you don't like this?

58
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:19,922
Looks like your belt is digesting
a small animal.

59
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:25,923
They got a cure for cancer.
See, it's all big business.

60
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:28,964
Oh, hey! Jerry just walked in.

61
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,884
Hi, George!

62
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,931
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Take my number.

63
00:03:34,102 --> 00:03:38,678
lt's 555-8643.

64
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:40,930
Okay. Here he is.

65
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:43,307
-Who is it?
-Take it.

66
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:46,893
-Who is it?
-lt's for you.

67
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:49,810
Hello?

68
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:52,645
Oh, hi, Joel.

69
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:55,770
No. l was out of town.
l just got back.

70
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,311
Kramer doesn't know anything.
He's just my next-door neighbour.

71
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:02,570
Nothing much. Tuesday?

72
00:04:03,322 --> 00:04:07,234
Tuesday, no.
l'm meeting somebody.

73
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:09,988
Wednesday?

74
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:14,148
Wednesday's okay. All right.

75
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:16,994
l'm a little busy right now.
Can we talk Wednesday morning?

76
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:18,737
Okay. Yeah.

77
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:21,483
Right. Thanks. Bye.

78
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,737
Why do you put me
on the phone with him?

79
00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:26,070
l hate just being handed a phone.

80
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:28,488
Well, it's your phone.
He wanted to talk to you.

81
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:30,703
Maybe l didn't want to talk to him.

82
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:32,782
-Well, why not?
-He bothers me.

83
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,080
l don't answer the phone anymore
because of him.

84
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:37,657
He's turned me into a screener.

85
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:40,661
Now l gotta see him on Wednesday.

86
00:04:40,837 --> 00:04:43,456
What? l thought we had tickets
to the Knick game Wednesday.

87
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:44,999
We got seats behind the bench.

88
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:47,543
-What happened? We're not going?
-We're going.

89
00:04:47,714 --> 00:04:49,753
That's next Wednesday.

90
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:54,164
-Who is this guy?
-His name's Joel Horneck.

91
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:57,009
He lived, like, three houses down
from me when l grew up.

92
00:04:57,176 --> 00:05:00,175
He had a Ping-Pong table.
We were friends.

93
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:04,802
Should l suffer the rest of my life
because l like to play Ping-Pong?

94
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,211
l was 1 0!

95
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:10,965
l would've been friends with Stalin
if he had a Ping-Pong table.

96
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:16,766
He's so self-involved.

97
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:22,140
That's for me.

98
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:24,596
Kramerica lndustries.

99
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:26,597
Hi, Mark.

100
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:30,181
No, no. Forget that.
l got a better idea.

101
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:32,431
A pizza place where you make
your own pie.

102
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:34,266
Can you conduct your business...

103
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:38,021
-...elsewhere?
-No, l'm talking about a whole chain.

104
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:40,191
Yeah.

105
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,396
l don't know why you bother
with this Ping-Pong guy, l tell you.

106
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,814
l don't bother with him.

107
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:49,986
He's been calling me for seven years.
l never called him once.

108
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:52,817
He's got the attention span
of a 5-year-old.

109
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:54,489
Sometimes l sit there...

110
00:05:54,657 --> 00:05:57,526
...and l make up things just to see
if he's paying attention.

111
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,154
l don't understand why
you spend time with this guy.

112
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,531
What can l do, break up with him?

113
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:05,866
Tell him, '' l don't think we're right
for each other.''

114
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:07,827
lt's a guy.

115
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,035
At least with a woman
there's a precedent.

116
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:12,161
The relationship goes sour,
you end it.

117
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,705
No, no, no. You have to approach
this as if he was a woman.

118
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:19,280
-Just break up with him?
-Absolutely.

119
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,576
-You just tell him the truth.
-The truth?

120
00:06:25,961 --> 00:06:29,707
No. As a guy, l don't know how
l can break up with another guy.

121
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,787
You know?
l don't know how to say:

122
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:34,713
'' Bill, l feel l need to see other men.''

123
00:06:35,464 --> 00:06:37,420
Know what l mean?
There is nothing l can do.

124
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,961
l have to wait for someone to die.

125
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,039
l think that's the only way
out of this relationship.

126
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:44,462
lt could be a long time.

127
00:06:45,718 --> 00:06:48,836
See the great thing about guys
is that we can become friends...

128
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:51,216
...based on almost nothing.

129
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:55,632
Just two guys will just become friends
just because they're two guys.

130
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:58,473
That's almost all we need
to have in common.

131
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,386
Because sports and women
is really all we talk about.

132
00:07:02,558 --> 00:07:05,676
lf there was no sports and no women,
the only thing guys would say is:

133
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:08,008
''So, what's in the refrigerator?''

134
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,052
So my shrink wants me to bring
my mother in for a session.

135
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,138
l mean, this guy is a brilliant man.

136
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:18,973
Lenny Bruce used to go to him...

137
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,890
...and l think, Geraldo.

138
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:25,890
l read the Lenny Bruce biography.
l thought it was...

139
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:27,644
Hey, hey, hey! We're starving here!

140
00:07:27,818 --> 00:07:30,224
-...interesting...
-We've been waiting here 1 0 minutes.

141
00:07:30,402 --> 00:07:31,896
...that he would....

142
00:07:34,404 --> 00:07:36,561
So l'm thinking about going
to lran this summer.

143
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:38,730
You know, l have to eat.

144
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:45,362
l mean, l'm hypoglycaemic.

145
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:49,658
Anyway, the Hezbollah
has invited me to perform.

146
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,284
-lt's their annual terrorist luncheon.
-Yeah.

147
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:00,744
l'm gonna do it in Farsi.

148
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:03,747
Do you think l need a haircut?

149
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:05,243
Are you ready?

150
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,906
Yeah, l'll have the egg salad
on whole wheat.

151
00:08:08,084 --> 00:08:11,498
Hey, let me ask you a question.
This turkey sandwich here...

152
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,743
...is that real turkey
or is it a turkey roll?

153
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,578
l don't want that processed turkey.

154
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:17,537
l hate it.

155
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:19,087
l think it's real turkey.

156
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:23,252
-ls there a real bird in the back?
-No, there's no bird, but--

157
00:08:23,423 --> 00:08:26,091
How do you know for sure?
Why don't you do me a favour.

158
00:08:26,258 --> 00:08:29,422
Why don't you go in the back
and find out, okay?

159
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:33,508
Unbelievable.

160
00:08:36,887 --> 00:08:39,174
How can you talk
to someone like that?

161
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,012
Look, what are you saying?
What, you like turkey roll?

162
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:47,429
Listen, Joel. There's something
l have to tell you.

163
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:49,759
Wait.

164
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:52,505
You'll never guess who l ran into.

165
00:08:52,684 --> 00:08:54,925
-Howard Metro.
-Howard Metro.

166
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:58,303
He asked me if l still saw you.
l said, ''Sure, l see him all the time.

167
00:08:58,478 --> 00:09:02,687
We're still great friends.''
Anyway, Howard says hello.

168
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:07,479
Listen, Joel.

169
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:10,890
l don't think we should
see each other anymore.

170
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:13,561
What?

171
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:16,188
This friendship, it's not working.

172
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:18,400
Not working?
What are you talking about?

173
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:22,230
We're just not suited to be friends.

174
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,446
-But how can you say that?
-Look, you're a nice guy.

175
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:28,068
lt's just that we don't have
anything in common.

176
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,196
Wait. What did l do?

177
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:32,487
Tell me what--
l want to know what l did.

178
00:09:32,658 --> 00:09:36,108
You didn't do anything.
lt's not you. lt's me.

179
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,076
lt's-- This is very difficult.

180
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:41,947
Look, l know l call you too much.
Right? l mean, l know.

181
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,036
-You're a very busy guy.
-No, it's not that.

182
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:49,120
You're one of the few people
l can talk to.

183
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,862
Look, come on.
Now, that's not true.

184
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,949
l always tell everybody about you.

185
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,958
l tell everybody to go see his show!

186
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:01,371
l mean, l'm your biggest fan.

187
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:03,915
-l know, l know.
-l mean, you're my best friend.

188
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:07,120
Best friend? l've never been
to your apartment.

189
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:09,964
l cannot believe that this
is happening! l can't believe it.

190
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:13,628
Okay, okay, forget it.
lt's okay. l didn't mean it.

191
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,590
-Didn't mean what?
-What l said.

192
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:19,125
-l've been under a lot of stress.
-Oh, you've been under a lot of stress.

193
00:10:20,844 --> 00:10:24,045
Look, just-- Can we just forget
the whole thing ever happened?

194
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,591
l'm sorry. l didn't mean it.
l took it out on you.

195
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:30,592
We're still friends.
We're still friends. Still friends.

196
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,135
Okay, look. l tell you what.
l got Knick tickets. This Wednesday.

197
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:38,798
Great seats behind the bench.
You want to come with me?

198
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:40,635
Come on.

199
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,184
Tonight?

200
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:46,141
No, next Wednesday. lf it was tonight,
l would've said tonight.

201
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:50,220
You really want me to go?

202
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:53,564
Yes.

203
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:59,727
-Okay.
-Here, take these.

204
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:03,099
Okay. Great. That would be--

205
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:05,766
That'd be great. So...

206
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:07,983
-...next Wednesday.
-Next Wednesday.

207
00:11:09,613 --> 00:11:11,937
Say, where is that waitress? Hey!

208
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:32,570
She calls me up at the office.
She says, ''We have to talk.''

209
00:11:33,497 --> 00:11:36,781
The four worst words
in the English language.

210
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:40,663
That or, ''Whose bra is this?''

211
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,623
That is worse.

212
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:44,991
So we order lunch,
and we're talking.

213
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:47,206
Finally, she blurts out
how it's not working.

214
00:11:47,377 --> 00:11:48,622
Really.

215
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:51,663
So, l'm thinking, as she's saying this,
l'm thinking, ''Great.

216
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,587
The relationship's over,
but the egg salad's on the way.''

217
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,754
So now l have a decision.
Do l walk or do l eat?

218
00:11:57,923 --> 00:11:59,796
You ate.

219
00:12:00,674 --> 00:12:03,080
Sat there for 20 minutes, chewing.

220
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:06,092
Staring at each other
in a defunct relationship.

221
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,045
Someone says,
''Get out of my life.''

222
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:11,673
And that doesn't affect
your appetite?

223
00:12:12,054 --> 00:12:13,630
Have you ever had
their egg salad?

224
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:16,554
-lt is unbelievable.
-lt's unbelievable.

225
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:19,342
Tell you what else is unbelievable.
l picked up the check.

226
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:21,672
She didn't even offer.
She ended it.

227
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:24,967
The least she could do is
send me off with a sandwich.

228
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:28,798
How much could you
possibly have in there?

229
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:30,470
Look, it's my money.

230
00:12:30,644 --> 00:12:33,015
All right? What should l do,
throw it out the window?

231
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:35,677
l know a guy who took
his vacation on his change.

232
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,976
Yeah? Where'd he go?
To an arcade?

233
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:41,099
That's funny. You're a funny guy.

234
00:12:41,523 --> 00:12:43,479
Come on, move up.

235
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:45,226
Great. Ewing's hurt.

236
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,774
How long is he gonna be out?

237
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:50,025
Well, a couple days
at the most, but....

238
00:12:50,193 --> 00:12:52,315
-Oh, God.
-l got scared there for a second.

239
00:12:52,486 --> 00:12:53,730
The Knicks without Ewing.

240
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:56,689
Listen, George.
A little problem with the game.

241
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,819
-What about it?
-The thing is, yesterday...

242
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:01,312
...l kind of....

243
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:06,857
-What?
-l gave your ticket to Horneck.

244
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:14,446
-You what?
-Yeah.

245
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,191
l'm sorry.
l had to give it to Horneck.

246
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:20,151
No.

247
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,248
My ticket?

248
00:13:25,415 --> 00:13:28,166
-You gave my ticket to Horneck?
-Come on. Go ahead. Move up.

249
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,875
What did you give him
my ticket for?

250
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,785
You didn't see him.
lt was horrible.

251
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,117
Oh, come on, Jerry.
l can't believe this!

252
00:13:34,294 --> 00:13:36,036
-l had to do it.
-Oh, please.

253
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:38,748
Can you change this into bills?

254
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:40,663
l'm sorry, sir, we can't do that.

255
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:42,379
Do you want to go with him?

256
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:44,622
-You go, l don't mind.
-l'm not going with him!

257
00:13:44,798 --> 00:13:46,457
l don't even know the guy!

258
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,422
Look, they did this for me before.

259
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:51,507
Look, l can give you these,
and you can roll them yourself.

260
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,295
You want me to roll 6000 of these?

261
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:56,875
What, should l quit my job?

262
00:13:57,345 --> 00:14:00,260
No, l do not like the bank.
l've heard the expression:

263
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:03,796
'' Laughing all the way to the bank.''
l've never seen anyone actually do it.

264
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:07,342
And those bank lines.

265
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:10,345
l hate it when there's
nobody on the line at all.

266
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,804
You now that part?
You go to the bank, it's empty...

267
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:16,058
...and you still have to go
through the little maze.

268
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:19,299
'' Could you get some cheese for me?
l'm almost at the front.

269
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:22,228
l'd like a reward for this, please.''

270
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:24,679
-Thirty-two, 33--
-George.

271
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:28,139
Not now, 33....

272
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:31,267
-Thirty....
-Could you stop the counting?

273
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:37,139
-What?
-Can l make it up to you?

274
00:14:37,318 --> 00:14:38,728
l'll give you $50 for the jug.

275
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:40,810
Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.

276
00:14:40,987 --> 00:14:43,061
Well, then l'm not gonna go
to the game either.

277
00:14:43,237 --> 00:14:45,691
Okay, l'll give him both tickets.

278
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:47,985
Go. Go!

279
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:55,189
l-- No, l don't want to go.

280
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:58,657
-He was really crying?
-l had to give him a tissue.

281
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:01,909
ln fact, let me call his machine now,
and l'll make up some excuse...

282
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:04,484
...why l can't go to the game either.

283
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,739
Wait. Wait a minute. As long
as you're gonna lie to the guy...

284
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:11,743
...why don't you tell him that you lost
both of the tickets. Then we can go.

285
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:14,203
George, the man wept.

286
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:17,071
Hey, guys.

287
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:21,080
Man, l'm telling you, this pizza idea
is really gonna happen.

288
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:26,747
This is the thing where you go and
you have to make your own pizza?

289
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:28,165
We give you the dough.

290
00:15:28,338 --> 00:15:31,670
You smash it. You pound it.
You fling it up in the air.

291
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,673
And then you get to put your sauce
and sprinkle your cheese.

292
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:38,421
And then,
you slide it into the oven.

293
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:42,383
You have to know how to do that.

294
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:46,168
You can't have people shoving
their arms into a 600-degree oven!

295
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,131
-lt's all supervised.
-Oh, well....

296
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:50,763
All of it!

297
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:54,093
-You want to invest?
-My money's tied up in change.

298
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:55,889
You know, look. l'm telling you.

299
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:58,926
People, they really want to make
their own pizza pie.

300
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:02,343
l have to say something,
with all due respect.

301
00:16:02,518 --> 00:16:05,553
l just never--
l can't imagine anyone...

302
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:08,513
...in any walk of life,
under any circumstance...

303
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:11,437
...wanting to make
their own pizza pie.

304
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:13,561
-But that's me.
-Well, okay.

305
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:15,722
-That's you.
-l'm just saying.

306
00:16:15,898 --> 00:16:19,100
l just wanted to check with you guys.
This business is going to be big.

307
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:21,183
l just want to-- Okay.

308
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,225
One day, you'll beg me
to make your own pie.

309
00:16:34,197 --> 00:16:37,232
Hi, Joel. This is Jerry.
l hope you get this before you--

310
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:39,731
Oh, hi, Joel. Oh, you just came in.

311
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:44,531
Listen, l can't make it
to the game tonight.

312
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:46,942
l have to tutor my nephew.

313
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:49,739
Yeah, he's got an exam tomorrow.

314
00:16:49,912 --> 00:16:51,950
Geometry.

315
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:54,618
You know, trapezoid, rhombus.

316
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:58,570
Anyway, listen, you take the tickets.
They're at the will-call window.

317
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:03,573
And l'm really sorry. Have a good time.
We'll talk next week, okay? Yeah.

318
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,157
Yeah. l don't-- Fine.

319
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:08,160
Fine, bye.

320
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:11,659
''Trapezoid''?

321
00:17:11,837 --> 00:17:14,753
l know. l'm really running out
of excuses with this guy.

322
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:17,411
l need some kind of excuse Rolodex.

323
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:27,508
Come on. Let's go do something.
l don't want to just sit around here.

324
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:29,300
-Wanna get something to eat?
-Where?

325
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:31,675
l don't care. l'm not hungry.

326
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,045
We could go to one of those
cappuccino places.

327
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,094
They let you just sit there.

328
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:39,302
What are we gonna do there, talk?

329
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:42,131
We can talk.

330
00:17:42,307 --> 00:17:44,133
l'll go if l don't have to talk.

331
00:17:46,142 --> 00:17:47,719
Then we'll just sit there.

332
00:17:48,184 --> 00:17:51,018
Okay, l'm gonna check
my machine first.

333
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:58,134
'' Picking someone up
at airport, jury duty...

334
00:17:58,313 --> 00:18:02,225
-...waiting for cable company.''
-Okay, just hand that over, please.

335
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:04,769
-What is this?
-lt's a list of excuses.

336
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:09,018
lt's for that guy Horneck, who's
at the game tonight with my tickets.

337
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:12,855
l have that list now, so in case
he calls, l just consult it...

338
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:14,734
...and l don't have to see him.

339
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,319
-God.
-l need it.

340
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:23,148
-What are you doing?
-l got some for you.

341
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:25,563
-Oh, l don't need any more.
-No, no, no.

342
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:27,779
These are good. Listen, listen.

343
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,819
''You ran out of underwear,
you can't leave the house.''

344
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:32,982
Very funny.

345
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,369
How about you've been diagnosed...

346
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:40,318
...as a multiple personality?
You're not even you.

347
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:42,369
You're Dan.

348
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,783
l'm Dan.

349
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:48,331
-Can l have my list back, please?
-Here. Here.

350
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,785
Jerry Seinfeld, l cannot
believe you are doing this.

351
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:53,997
This is absolutely infantile.

352
00:18:56,711 --> 00:19:00,327
-What can l do?
-Deal with it. Be a man.

353
00:19:00,504 --> 00:19:01,962
Oh, no.

354
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:07,581
That's impossible. l'd rather
lie to him the rest of my life...

355
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:09,630
...than go through that again.

356
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,997
He was crying.

357
00:19:11,508 --> 00:19:14,922
Tears, accompanied by mucus.

358
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:17,837
You made a man cry?

359
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:20,094
l never made a man cry.

360
00:19:20,262 --> 00:19:24,127
l even kicked a guy in the groin once,
and he didn't cry.

361
00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:26,296
l got the cab.

362
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,677
A couple of tough monkeys.

363
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:34,884
Hi, Elaine.

364
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:36,683
Hey, you missed
a great game tonight.

365
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:38,179
-Game?
-Knick game.

366
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:41,517
Horneck took me. We're sitting
two rows behind the bench.

367
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:43,844
We were getting hit by sweat!

368
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:47,346
Wait. How does Horneck know you?

369
00:19:47,522 --> 00:19:50,012
Last week, when l, you know,
gave you the phone.

370
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,932
He's really into my pizza place idea.

371
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,478
-This is too much.
-Wait. What pizza place idea?

372
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,476
Oh, no.

373
00:19:56,693 --> 00:19:58,518
You get to make your own pie.

374
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:02,940
That sounds like a great idea.
lt would be fun.

375
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:04,771
-Kramer!
-Yeah!

376
00:20:04,946 --> 00:20:06,439
Perfect.

377
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:08,023
Hey!

378
00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:11,692
Okay, who wants meat loaf?

379
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:13,859
-No, thanks.
-No, no.

380
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:16,024
lt's gonna be hot in a minute.

381
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:19,326
So l thought you were
tutoring your nephew.

382
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:22,736
-We finished early.
-l'll bet.

383
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:27,158
So are you going to introduce me
to your nephew?

384
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,163
Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.

385
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:32,867
Whoa, Nelson.

386
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,245
This is Elaine.

387
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,783
-l thought you guys split up.
-We're still friends.

388
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,162
So....

389
00:20:41,543 --> 00:20:44,745
Thanks again for those tickets,
But next week, l'm gonna take you.

390
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,374
How about next Tuesday night?
Why don't you come along.

391
00:20:47,754 --> 00:20:53,042
Oh, no, no. Tuesday's no good
because we've got choir practice.

392
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,047
Right.

393
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:57,006
-Forgot about choir.
-Yeah.

394
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,415
We're-- We're doing that evening...

395
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,879
...of Eastern European
national anthems.

396
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:03,379
Right. You know...

397
00:21:03,552 --> 00:21:06,124
...the wall being down and everything.

398
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:10,635
Well, what about Thursday night?
l mean, they're playing the Sonics.

399
00:21:11,597 --> 00:21:16,552
Thursday is not good because
we've gotta get to the hospital...

400
00:21:16,724 --> 00:21:20,091
...to see if we qualify
as those organ donors.

401
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:22,057
l should really try
something like that.

402
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:25,011
You really should.

403
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,513
Well, let's just take a look here.

404
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,228
Forty-one home games.

405
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:32,683
Let's see, Saturday night
we got the Mavericks.

406
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:35,309
lf you don't like the Mavericks,
next Tuesday, Lakers.

407
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:37,058
l mean, you gotta like Magic, right?

408
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:39,899
Now, let's see. On the road,
on the road, on the road....

409
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,892
Back, back on the 1 4th.

410
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,232
They play the Bulls.
You can't miss Air Jordan....

411
00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:49,476
l've come to the conclusion that there
are certain friends in your life...

412
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:52,688
...that they're just always your friends,
and you have to accept it.

413
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:55,732
You see them. You don't want
to see them. You don't call them.

414
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:57,482
They call you.

415
00:21:57,656 --> 00:21:59,861
You don't call back,
they call again.

416
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:03,274
The way to get through talking
with people...

417
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,109
...you have nothing in common with...

418
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:07,987
...is to pretend you're hosting
your own little talk show.

419
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,864
This is what l do. Pretend there's
a little desk around you.

420
00:22:11,036 --> 00:22:14,617
There's a little chair over there,
and you interview them.

421
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:16,744
The only problem is,
there's no way to say:

422
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:19,866
'' Hey, it's been great having
you on the show.

423
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,992
We're out of time.''
