00:00:01,791 --> 00:00:04,624
Now, I was thinking
the other day about hair

2
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:07,091
and that the weird thing
about it is that

3
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:10,124
people will touch
other people's hair.

4
00:00:10,158 --> 00:00:13,091
You will actually kiss another
human being right on the head.

5
00:00:13,124 --> 00:00:16,758
But if one of those hairs
should somehow be able

6
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:20,258
to get out of that skull
and go off on its own,

7
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:23,824
it is now the vilest,
most disgusting thing

8
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,158
that you can encounter.

9
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:28,491
The same hair.

10
00:00:28,524 --> 00:00:30,000
People freak out.
"There was a hair

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,024
People freak out.
"There was a hair

12
00:00:30,058 --> 00:00:33,124
in the egg salad."

Say it's Saturday night in Spain.

14
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:41,689
They go out dancing.

15
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:43,856
Think they do the flamenco?

16
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:45,689
I would think.

17
00:00:45,722 --> 00:00:47,322
So you could a woman
for a date,

18
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:50,189
ask her if she's free
for dinner and a flamenco.

19
00:00:50,222 --> 00:00:53,722
You don't flamenco
on the first date.

20
00:00:53,756 --> 00:00:55,722
I wish the flamenco
was popular here.

21
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:56,789
Yeah? Would you do it?

22
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:58,156
Yes, I think I would.

24
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:01,022
Well, I knew you had
an affinity for it,

25
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:03,522
because it's the dance
of a very proud people.

26
00:01:03,556 --> 00:01:04,701
Hello.

27
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:05,222
Hello.

Oh, hi, Nana.

29
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:08,022
What?

30
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:10,189
Oh, all right.
Okay, don't worry about.

31
00:01:10,222 --> 00:01:12,189
Okay, I'll see you later.

32
00:01:12,222 --> 00:01:13,822
All right, bye.

to my grandmother's.

What for?

35
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:18,389

of ketchup for her.

36

So, what, no lunch?

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:22,789
No, we have time.

40

Sometimes she has trouble
distinguishing between

the past and the present.
Yeah.

42
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,956
You know, there's got to be
an easier way to open ketchup.

43
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:33,556
They should make it in a tube.

44
00:01:33,589 --> 00:01:34,701
Like toothpaste?
Yeah.

45
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:35,689
Like toothpaste?
Yeah.

There's a
squeeze ketchup.

47
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,189
I've seen
squeeze mustard.

48
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:39,689
I've never seen
squeeze ketchup.

49
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:41,222
Well, if they make
squeeze mustard,

50
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:43,722
doesn't it stand to reason
that they make squeeze ketchup?

51
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:44,689
Not necessarily.

52
00:01:44,722 --> 00:01:46,322
Mustard lends itself
to the squeeze.

53

I really don't see
the difference.

Oh, she's with
her friend Wendy.

00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:01,456
Is that the physical
therapist?

63
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,456
Yeah, I'm on a kiss-hello
program with her.

64
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:04,689
Really?

65
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:06,656
Yeah, every time I see her,
I gotta kiss hello.

66
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,156
I just did it once
on her birthday.

67
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:09,522
Somehow it mushroomed.

68
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:12,022
Now I dread seeing her
because of it.

you admired me for anything.

You're a physical
therapist, right?

00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:35,889
Yes.

little swelling here.

it's kind of tender.

like a lot of trouble.

by my office later.

for you a little.

my card.

Oh, thank you.

97
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:54,489
Well, I'll see you
guys later.

98
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:55,856
Nice meeting you.
Bye, Elaine.

99
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:56,889
Bye, Wendy.
I'm sorry.

Bye, Jerry.
Bye.

that for?

I still don't see why I can't
ask her about my arm?

She's a physical therapist.

106
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,056

with that outside of the office.

Why not?

108
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:15,656
Because it is what she does.

of an office.

When huge sums of money
are involved,

114
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:28,189
then the delicate genius
can be disturbed.

something right here.

so important.

the kiss program with her.

Well, you know, frankly,

123
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:42,056
outside of a sexual
relationship,

124
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,356

the handshaking either.

an old high school yearbook.

132
00:03:58,089 --> 00:03:59,522
You should say something to her.

133
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:01,656
Oh, I could never say
anything to her about that.

134
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:03,722
Yeah, Kramer's the only
person who could say

135
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:04,701
something like that.

00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:05,022

Well, just tell Kramer
to tell her.

00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:10,689
No, if you tell him to do it,
he'll never do it.

is introduce him,

come out with it.

00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,740
Hey. Hi, Cosmo.

531
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:31,040
Oh, hey, Jack.
How you doing?

532
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:32,274
Hi, Jack.

533
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,207
Hey, Julio,
I was wondering,

534
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,107
could you get to that shower
today, you think?

535
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,040
Oh, I see. When you need
something done,

536
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:42,840
then you're very friendly
to people, huh?

537
00:18:42,874 --> 00:18:44,074
No, no.
That's not true.

538
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:45,274
Well, I think it is.

539
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:47,374
It's a big building, Seinfeld.

540
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:48,940
Maybe I'll get to it someday.

541
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:51,707
After I take care of the people
that are civil to each other.

542
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:57,712
NURSE:
Yeah, she's upstairs, playing cards.

543
00:18:57,712 --> 00:18:57,740
NURSE:
Yeah, she's upstairs, playing cards.

544
00:18:57,774 --> 00:18:59,540
You know, she really
doesn't belong here.

545
00:18:59,574 --> 00:19:01,174
My uncle put her here

546
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,840
because he's trying to prove
he doesn't owe my mother $50.

547
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:05,940
Well, she seems very happy.

548
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:09,007
She met an old friend who used
to live next door to her.

549
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,674
Buddy?

550
00:19:10,707 --> 00:19:12,340
Yes, that's his name.

551
00:19:12,374 --> 00:19:13,607
He's right over there.

552
00:19:17,307 --> 00:19:18,274
WENDY:
I'm sorry.

553
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:19,874
I don't owe you anything.

554
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:22,007
I had some personal
business that day.

555
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,940
Oh, I see. So your time
is more valuable than mine.

556
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:26,040
Is that it?

557
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:27,374
You're a delicate genius.

558
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:27,712
A delicate genius?

559
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:29,274
A delicate genius?

560
00:19:29,307 --> 00:19:30,540
Elaine.

561
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:31,574
George.

562
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,140
Good luck.

563
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,440
What's going on?

564
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:39,440
Wendy, I injured my shoulder

565
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:41,374
Wednesday when--
When you dropped me off

566
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:43,274
and I had to carry
my skis and my boots

567
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,274
and my poles and everything
all the way home.

568
00:19:45,307 --> 00:19:47,507
I'm having trouble
lifting my arm.

569
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,440
Do you think you could
give me some treatment?

570
00:19:49,474 --> 00:19:50,774
Oh, sure.

571
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:53,174
You have insurance, right?

572
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:54,874
Insurance?

573
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:56,607
You're charging me?

574
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,712
Wednesday?

575
00:19:57,712 --> 00:19:57,874
Wednesday?

576
00:19:57,907 --> 00:20:00,274
That's your personal business?

577
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:01,607
Skiing?!

578
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,774
Oh, sure, let people suffer
while you're shooshing

579
00:20:03,807 --> 00:20:04,840
all over a mountain!

580
00:20:04,874 --> 00:20:06,340
How did you hear that?

581
00:20:06,374 --> 00:20:09,674
I hear everything.

582
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:10,940
All right, why don't you two

583
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:13,074
just take
your business elsewhere.

584
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:15,940
Ho-ho!
That is a good idea.

585
00:20:15,974 --> 00:20:17,107
Come on, George.

586
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,107
Yeah. Let's go.

587
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,274
And you know,

588
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:25,607
you might want to do
something about that hair.

589
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,712
Why? What's wrong
with my hair?

590
00:20:27,712 --> 00:20:27,907
Why? What's wrong
with my hair?

591
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,274
I think it's a little
old-fashioned, don't you?

592
00:20:32,307 --> 00:20:33,274
Tell her.

593
00:20:33,307 --> 00:20:35,140
She's right.

594
00:20:36,474 --> 00:20:38,274
So you were with him
that day at the track.

595
00:20:38,307 --> 00:20:39,574
Oh, yeah.

596
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:41,107
He won $1000.

597
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,774
His son was there too.

598
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:43,774
Leo?

599
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:45,740
Yeah, that's it.
Leo.

600
00:20:45,774 --> 00:20:48,240
Oh, what an obnoxious
little kid.

601
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:50,774
He used to steal
my soda bottles

602
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:52,240
and cash them in
for the deposit.

603
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:54,207
Is that so?

604
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,374
And after your grandfather
hit the daily double,

605
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:57,712
he give him $100 and told him
to give 50 to his sister.

606
00:20:57,712 --> 00:20:59,374
he give him $100 and told him
to give 50 to his sister.

607
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:02,340
His sister? Well, I say
he should give it to me

608
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:03,940
for all the bottles
he took.

609
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:07,174
Well, that's
very interesting.

610
00:21:07,207 --> 00:21:08,607
Uncle Leo.

611
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,174
I just met an old
acquaintance of yours.

612
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:12,540
You remember Buddy.

613
00:21:12,574 --> 00:21:14,740
He just told me
quite a story

614
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,040
about you and Grandpa
at the track.

615
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:18,174
Wait a second--

616
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:19,540
You're busted.

617
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,407
Hey, Steve,
how you doing?

618
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:27,712
Hey, Jeff,
what's happening?

619
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:28,407
Hey, Jeff,
what's happening?

620
00:21:30,307 --> 00:21:31,274
Mary?

621
00:21:31,307 --> 00:21:32,907
Oh, Mary.

622
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,607
Give us a kiss.
Don't be like that, Mary.

623
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,840
Come on.
I made a mistake.

624
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:37,674
Look, why don't you do
everybody a favor

625
00:21:37,707 --> 00:21:39,174
and just get out
of this building.

626
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:40,340
Nobody wants you here.

627
00:21:40,374 --> 00:21:41,707
Nobody!

628
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,274
JEFF:
Hi, Mary.

629
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:44,440
Hi, Jeff.
How are you?

630
00:21:44,474 --> 00:21:46,007
Hi, Steve.
How are you?

631
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,340
Hey, let's go
get some coffee.

632
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:48,840
Oh, that'd be great.
Great idea.

633
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,940
I gotta go down to
the corner, but...

634
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:56,207
Oh, Paul.
Could you hold that door?

635
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:12,507
Hey, could I use your shower?

636
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,340
What, again?
You took one this morning.

637
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,040
Well, I got a date.
Come on. Please?

638
00:22:16,074 --> 00:22:18,407
I know, but, you know,
I got a little problem.

639
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,740
Wendy here?
No, no.

640
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:21,007
She changed her hair style.

641
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,607
It's terrible.
No, we're done.

642
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,840
I'll go get
some more beer.

643
00:22:24,874 --> 00:22:25,940
Oh, yeah, yeah, great.

644
00:22:25,974 --> 00:22:28,440
And get some of those
blue corn chips.

645
00:22:28,474 --> 00:22:30,107
Hey.
Hi, Cosmo.

646
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,607
Hi.

647
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,074
Ooh. I like that.

648
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:34,074
Who was that?

649
00:22:34,107 --> 00:22:35,074
Stephanie, 2G.

650
00:22:35,107 --> 00:22:35,282
Oh, man.

651
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:36,407
Oh, man.

652
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,274
Looks like you got quite
a few people in here.

653
00:22:38,307 --> 00:22:39,940
Yeah, well, you know
I'd invite you in,

654
00:22:39,974 --> 00:22:41,607
but, uh, you know...

655
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,407
Oh, I understand.
