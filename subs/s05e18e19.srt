1
00:00:01,608 --> 00:00:02,808
I really feel,
as human beings,

2
00:00:02,842 --> 00:00:05,910
we need more training
in our basic social skills,

3
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:07,410
conversational distance.

4
00:00:07,444 --> 00:00:09,077
Don't you hate these people
that talk to you,

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,910
they talk into your mouth,
like you're a clown at a drive-thru?

6
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:14,310
And handshakes is the worst.

7
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:16,877
There's absolutely
no guidelines for handshakes.

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,310
You know how many people--?
Too strong, too weak.

9
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:20,844
Sometimes they give you
the three-quarter handshake,

10
00:00:20,877 --> 00:00:22,844
just the fingers.

11
00:00:22,877 --> 00:00:24,477
Early release, late release.

12
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,144
Sometimes people will
dispute your release.

13
00:00:27,177 --> 00:00:29,910
You've let go.
They're hanging on.

14
00:00:29,944 --> 00:00:30,000
I have actually
said to people,

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,577
I have actually
said to people,

16
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,844
"Hey, the handshake is over."

17
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,377
Too many pumps,

18
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,744
coming in too high.

19
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:41,410
Too sweaty.
From too far away.

20
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:43,577
Sometimes a guy will give
you a strong grip,

21
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,544
late release, and pull you in
for the too-close conversation.

22
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:50,344
To him I say,
"That's three strikes. You're out."

23
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:54,277
(♪)

24
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,477
You know, the timing
couldn't be worse.

25
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,077
Is there ever a good time
to have your parents stay with you?

26
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,477
You don't understand.

27
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,244
I haven't been together
with Rachel for, like, three weeks.

28
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:07,310
First I was on the road,
then my parents show up.

29
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:09,344
I'm getting a little,
uh, backed up.

30
00:01:11,677 --> 00:01:12,744
When are they leaving
for Paris?

31
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:13,910
Not for another three days.

32
00:01:13,944 --> 00:01:14,977
What about her place?

33
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,644
She lives with
her parents.

34
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,310
Really?

35
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:19,744
Hey, maybe this will become,
like, a cool thing,

36
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:21,635
living with your parents.

37
00:01:21,635 --> 00:01:21,977
living with your parents.

38
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,610
Yeah, then maybe
baldness will catch on.

39
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,377
Things will all be
turning your way.

40
00:01:29,077 --> 00:01:31,710
Hey, believe me,
baldness will catch on.

41
00:01:31,744 --> 00:01:33,144
When the aliens come,

42
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,377
who do you think
they're gonna relate to?

43
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,477
Who do you think is
gonna be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?

44
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,710
The baldies.

45
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:40,710
Hey, my parents
want to have your parents over

46
00:01:40,744 --> 00:01:42,010
for dinner before
they leave town.

47
00:01:42,044 --> 00:01:44,310
Good. Then I get
the apartment for at least one night.

48
00:01:44,344 --> 00:01:45,810
I'm paying for
this whole Paris trip.

49
00:01:45,844 --> 00:01:47,177
It's their
anniversary present.

50
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,710
Hey, guys.

51
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:50,844
Hey, Alec.
Hey, Alec.

52
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:51,635
This is Joey.

53
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:51,977
This is Joey.

54
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,010
Hey, Joey. How you doing?

55
00:01:53,044 --> 00:01:54,310
Hi.
Hey, listen.

56
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:55,810
I was wondering if
either one of you guys

57
00:01:55,844 --> 00:01:57,177
would be interested
in doing some work

58
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,677
for the Big Brother
program.

59
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,810
I'm kinda running
the local chapter.

60
00:02:01,844 --> 00:02:03,444
What do you say,
George?

61
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,044
Well, uh--

62
00:02:05,077 --> 00:02:07,544
Wouldn't you
like to be a big brother

63
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,644
to someone like me?

64
00:02:09,677 --> 00:02:10,877
Please?

65
00:02:11,844 --> 00:02:13,044
Well...

66
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:15,544
Sure, Joey. Sure.

67
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:18,810
I would be thrilled.

68
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:20,044
That's great, George.
Thanks.

69
00:02:20,077 --> 00:02:21,477
I'll get in touch
with you.

70
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,635
Wouldn't you like
to be a big brother--?

71
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:23,144
Wouldn't you like
to be a big brother--?

72
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,410
All right, Joey.
That's enough. Let's go.

73
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:27,144
See you.

74
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:28,244
What happened?

75
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:29,544
What could I do?

76
00:02:29,577 --> 00:02:31,344
Did you see the mug
on that kid?

77
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:34,310
Wouldn't you like
to pass the ketchup

78
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:36,710
to someone like me?

79
00:02:36,744 --> 00:02:38,810
Please?

80
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:40,410
Hey, have you noticed
they moved

81
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:42,077
where they do
the interview on <i>Jeopardy</i> now?

82
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,310
Yeah, it used to be
right in the middle of Single Jeopardy.

83
00:02:44,344 --> 00:02:45,810
Now they do it
right after Single Jeopardy.

84
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:47,310
Yeah. It's much better,
isn't it?

85
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:49,244
Oh, no comparison.

86
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:51,010
Hey, I gotta stop
at the bookstore, to get my parents one of those

87
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:51,635
French-English
dictionaries.

88
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:53,077
French-English
dictionaries.

89
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,710
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

90
00:02:54,744 --> 00:02:56,210
What?

91
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:57,810
Your parents are
going to Paris, right?

92
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,977
Yeah.

93
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,410
So, I tell Alec

94
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:01,844
that I have to
go to Paris

95
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:03,810
for an undetermined
amount of time.

96
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:05,510
Then all I have to do
is buy some postcards

97
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:08,310
and have your parents
mail them from Paris.

98
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:10,010
What about
little Joey?

99
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:11,477
Who?

100
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,310
I think he's probably
better off.

101
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:17,377
GEORGE:
I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program.

102
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,977
So, when you get
to Paris, all you have to do is

103
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,144
drop them
in any mailbox.

104
00:03:20,177 --> 00:03:21,635
But there are
no stamps on these.

105
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:21,877
But there are
no stamps on these.

106
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,577
Well, no, not yet.
You got to buy French stamps.

107
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,144
I'll-- I'll reimburse you,
of course.

108
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:28,310
Why are you
doing this?

109
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:29,844
He wants this guy
to think he's in Paris.

110
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,477
Why?

111
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,544
Because George
is a deeply-disturbed individual.

112
00:03:35,077 --> 00:03:36,877
Oh, hey.
Helen, uh...

113
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,377
could I use some more
of your hand lotion?

114
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,910
I told you it was good.
Yeah.

115
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:43,210
It's from the Saks
Fifth Avenue in Miami.

116
00:03:43,244 --> 00:03:46,144
Mm. I'm gonna remember that
if I'm ever in Florida.

117
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:47,477
Yeah. Or if you're
ever on Fifth Avenue

118
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,310
here in
New York City.

119
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:51,077
You can get some there.
Yeah?

120
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,635
Say, those are nice pants.

121
00:03:51,635 --> 00:03:52,477
Say, those are nice pants.

122
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,977
I got a pair
just like them at home.

123
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,377
That doesn't
surprise me.

124
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,510
I bought these
at Rudy's.

125
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,144
It's a used
clothing store.

126
00:03:58,177 --> 00:04:00,644
See, when people
like you die...

127
00:04:00,677 --> 00:04:03,310
the widows, they bring
in their wardrobes.

128
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,044
They make a bundle.

129
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:06,810
Really?

130
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:08,310
My father's got a ton
of old clothes,

131
00:04:08,344 --> 00:04:09,477
just sitting up
in the attic.

132
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,544
You think they're
worth something?

133
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:12,144
Yeah, if they're vintage...

134
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:14,177
and you're a widow.

135
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,844
What happens if the husband
dies after the wife?

136
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:18,744
Who brings
the clothing in then?

137
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:20,344
I suppose
the children do.

138
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:21,635
Yes, I suppose they do.

139
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:23,677
Yes, I suppose they do.

140
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:27,710
All right. I got a 10:00.
I'll see everybody later.

141
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,477
Hey, ooh,
I just remembered.

142
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,644
My parents really
wanna have you guys over for dinner

143
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:42,744
before you leave town.

144
00:04:42,777 --> 00:04:43,810
What about
tonight?

145
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:44,910
Tonight?

146
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:46,710
Yeah. They're making
paella.

147
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,744
Uh... Oh, I don't think
we can make it tonight.

148
00:04:48,777 --> 00:04:49,977
We have plans.

149
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,077
What plans?

150
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,635
We have plans.

151
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:53,010
We have plans.

152
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:54,144
Where did you
get plans?

153
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:55,710
We have plans.

154
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:58,544
Oh. Well, um...
what about tomorrow night?

155
00:04:58,577 --> 00:04:59,744
Maybe.

156
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,077
Okay, uh...

157
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,244
I guess I'll
tell them that.

158
00:05:06,277 --> 00:05:07,710
Hey, give them
our best, though.

159
00:05:07,744 --> 00:05:09,177
Yeah.
I'll call you later.

160
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,344
Yeah.

161
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:16,510
So, what plans
do you have?

162
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:17,977
None.

163
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,744
So, how come
you're not going over there for dinner?

164
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,635
Jerry, we don't
care much for the Costanzas.

165
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:22,177
Jerry, we don't
care much for the Costanzas.

166
00:05:23,277 --> 00:05:25,044
We can't stand them.

167
00:05:26,344 --> 00:05:27,644
Really? Since when?

168
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:30,210
Since always.
We've never liked them.

169
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:31,644
Why?

170
00:05:31,677 --> 00:05:33,477
They're so loud.
They're always fighting.

171
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,244
It's uncomfortable.
You never noticed?

172
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:37,044
Oh, I noticed.
But they're from your age group.

173
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:39,010
I didn't think
you could detect abnormal behavior

174
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:41,310
among your own kind.

175
00:05:41,344 --> 00:05:42,510
Well, we do.

176
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:44,177
(DOORBELL BUZZES)

177
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,210
Yeah?

<i>(ELAINE AND AARON LAUGHING)</i>

179
00:05:47,377 --> 00:05:48,477
ELAINE:
<i>It's us.</i>

180
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,044
Oh. Come on up.

181
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,635
It's Elaine. You don't have
a problem with her, do you?

182
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:53,244
It's Elaine. You don't have
a problem with her, do you?

183
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:54,377
We adore Elaine.

184
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,144
She wants to say "Hi"
with her new boyfriend.

185
00:05:56,177 --> 00:05:57,310
What's he like?

186
00:05:57,344 --> 00:05:58,744
He's nice.
Bit of a close talker.

187
00:05:58,777 --> 00:05:59,910
A what?

188
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:02,144
You'll see.

189
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:03,510
I really had no idea that

190
00:06:03,544 --> 00:06:05,477
you felt this way
about the Costanzas.

191
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,077
They're exhausting.
It's like being in an asylum.

192
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,577
(BOTH):
Hi.

193
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,677
There she is.

194
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,744
Hello, Elaine!

195
00:06:13,777 --> 00:06:14,844
Hi,
Mrs. Seinfeld.

196
00:06:15,844 --> 00:06:17,044
Oh...this is Aaron.

197
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,210
Hello, Aaron.

198
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,310
Hello.
Hello, Aaron.

199
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:20,910
So, how long are
you folks in town?

200
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:21,635
Oh.

201
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:22,010
Oh.

202
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,310
Three more days.

203
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:26,144
Three more days,
and then we're off to Paris.

204
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,244
Ah.

205
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:29,410
We're going with
a select charter group.

206
00:06:29,444 --> 00:06:32,310
I love France.
I was just there last year.

207
00:06:32,344 --> 00:06:34,710
In fact...you know,

208
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:37,477
I still have an envelope
full of French francs.

209
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,210
I'll give them to you.

210
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:40,977
We can't take money.

211
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,977
No. It's a gift.
From us.

212
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,644
Oh, that is so nice,
Aaron.

213
00:06:47,677 --> 00:06:49,310
Isn't he nice?

214
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:51,410
Has Jerry been
showing you a good time?

215
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:51,635
No, I haven't.

216
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:53,377
No, I haven't.

217
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,710
You know,
I have a friend

218
00:06:55,744 --> 00:06:59,244
who works at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

219
00:06:59,277 --> 00:07:01,010
How'd you like
a behind-the-scenes tour?

220
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:03,177
Really? You could
do that?

221
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,410
Easily.

222
00:07:04,444 --> 00:07:05,544
It wouldn't be
any trouble?

223
00:07:05,577 --> 00:07:06,710
Of course not.

224
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:08,010
When could we go?

225
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:09,144
How about right now?

226
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:10,244
I'm ready.

227
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:11,644
Are you sure?
Yes!

228
00:07:11,677 --> 00:07:13,710
Okay, let me get my coat.

229
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:15,077
Elaine,
what do you say?

230
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,644
Well, I don't
think so, Aaron.

231
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:20,510
Uh...I have plans.

232
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:21,635
Oh.

233
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:22,410
Oh.

234
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:24,477
How about you,
Jerry?

235
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,877
I'm swamped.

236
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,844
You sure?
You can examine the artwork up close.

237
00:07:29,877 --> 00:07:31,377
Maybe I'll try
and catch up with you.

238
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:33,744
Yeah, that'll
happen.

239
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,810
All right.
We're off.

240
00:07:35,844 --> 00:07:36,977
Okay. Bye.

241
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,210
Okay, bye-bye.
Have a good time.

242
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:40,410
Bye.
See everybody later.

243
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:42,810
Okay.
Bye.

244
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:45,244
Why would he ask your parents
to go to a museum?

245
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:47,477
I don't know.
What is that?

246
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,544
Maybe he was just
trying to be nice.

247
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:51,635
Have you ever heard of anyone
doing anything like this?

248
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:52,177
Have you ever heard of anyone
doing anything like this?

249
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,044
Wait a second. He just
did me a big favor.

250
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:56,144
What?

251
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:58,044
He got them
out of the house. What?

252
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,310
I can call Rachel.

253
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:00,377
Oh.

254
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,477
Oh, no.
I got the machine.

255
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,910
Rachel, are you there?

256
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:06,144
I got the place to myself
for a few hours. Rachel!

257
00:08:06,177 --> 00:08:07,877
Where are you?

258
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,277
Rachel!

259
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:13,744
Sorry, pal.
Wish I could help you out.

261
00:08:17,544 --> 00:08:18,577
FRANK:
They're not coming?

262
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,877
No. They had
plans.

263
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,044
How could they
have plans?

264
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:21,635
That's what
I wanna know.

265
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:22,144
That's what
I wanna know.

266
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:23,410
What difference
does it make?

267
00:08:23,444 --> 00:08:25,710
They wouldn't lie to us.
They're our dear friends.

268
00:08:25,744 --> 00:08:28,077
What am I supposed to do
with all this paella?

269
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,644
They said tomorrow,
maybe.

270
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,744
Maybe?
Maybe they don't like us.

271
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,510
Why wouldn't they
like us?

272
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:34,844
(GASPS)

273
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,677
Again with the pepper?

274
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,210
What do you gotta use
all that pepper for?

275
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:40,877
Ah, keep quiet.

276
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,577
What are you,
trying to set my mouth on fire?

277
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,010
I don't know what
the reason could be.

278
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,677
(LAUGHTER)

279
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,635
Hello.
Oh, hi.

00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:52,310
Hello.
Oh, hi.

281
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:54,077
What a day.

282
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,144
Ah, Jerry, you would
not believe the time we had.

283
00:08:57,177 --> 00:08:59,044
Aaron is quite
the tour guide.

284
00:08:59,077 --> 00:09:01,544
Jerry, have you ever seen
any of those Impressionist paintings?

285
00:09:01,577 --> 00:09:03,077
Oh, sure, like Monet.

286
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,310
Don't you think
he had to be, uh, nearsighted?

287
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,477
I mean, nobody would paint
like that if they could see.

288
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,310
It's all out of focus.

289
00:09:09,344 --> 00:09:10,910
Well, he's from
the Impressionist school,

290
00:09:10,944 --> 00:09:12,677
you know,
like Monet, Manet,

291

Tippy-tippy-day-day.

292
00:09:14,677 --> 00:09:17,644
I say that guy was painting
without his glasses.

(TELEPHONE RINGS)

294
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,144
Hello.

295
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:21,635
Rachel.

296
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:22,344
Rachel.

297
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,077
Yeah.

298
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,844
Uh, no.
They're back.

299
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,377
Jerry, if you have
something to do,

300
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,477
we can just
sit right here and read.

301
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,977
Yes.

302
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,477
Well, uh,
I'm sorry too.

303
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,077
Listen...
I'll call you later.

304
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,810
Okay, bye.

305
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:41,410
Well,
I should be going.

306
00:09:41,444 --> 00:09:43,244
Oh, thanks
again.

307
00:09:43,277 --> 00:09:44,377
Goodbye.
Bye.

308
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,477
Hey.

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,810
Oh, you must be
Kramer.

310
00:09:47,844 --> 00:09:49,177
I've heard
about you.

311
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,577
Hey, you must be Aaron.
I've heard about you.

312

(LAUGHS)

313
00:09:58,677 --> 00:09:59,744
Well, see you later.

314
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:01,210
Yeah.

315
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:02,510
Bye.
Okay.

316
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:06,577
So, what are you guys
doing for dinner?

317
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,910
We have no plans.

318
00:10:07,944 --> 00:10:09,144
Look at that, Helen.

319
00:10:09,177 --> 00:10:10,544
Do you see what
he's wearing?

320
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:11,810
That's the Executive.

321
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,044
What is the Executive?

322
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:15,310
The beltless trench coat.
My father invented it.

323
00:10:15,344 --> 00:10:17,977
I sure did.
Raincoats were my business.

324
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,810
The Executive
was a classic.

325
00:10:19,844 --> 00:10:21,635
These haven't
been made in 20 years.

326
00:10:21,635 --> 00:10:21,810
These haven't
been made in 20 years.

327
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:23,677
Why would they?
Nobody bought them then.

328
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:25,910
He's wearing one.

329
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:27,844
These are a hot item
at Rudy's.

330
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,710
You don't say.

331
00:10:29,744 --> 00:10:33,210
You know, I have boxes
of those sitting in my garage in Florida.

332
00:10:33,244 --> 00:10:34,510
Get them up here.

333
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:37,477
You give me 25 percent,
I'll take care of everything.

334
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,810
You got a deal.

335
00:10:38,844 --> 00:10:41,044
Yeah.

336
00:10:41,077 --> 00:10:43,044
This is like the meeting
of Smith and Wesson.

337
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,744
I'll call
Jack Klompus.

338
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:47,410
He's got a key
to the garage.

339
00:10:47,444 --> 00:10:48,810
He can send them
overnight delivery.

340
00:10:48,844 --> 00:10:51,044
You're gonna first start
shipping boxes?

341
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:51,635
We're leaving for Paris
in three days.

342
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:53,210
We're leaving for Paris
in three days.

343
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:54,810
He'll send them
express.

344
00:10:54,844 --> 00:10:56,177
You're crazy.

345
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,677
I'll tell you
how crazy I am.

346
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,544
I'm gonna pay for
this whole trip with these coats.

347
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:01,144
I'm paying
for the trip.

348
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:03,044
So much the better.

349
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,810
Anyway, it's kind of
a fluke thing, but, uh,

350
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:12,477
I'll be leaving for Paris
in two days and...

351
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,744
I will send you a postcard
when I get there.

352
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,177
Paris, huh?

353
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,310
Yeah, yeah.
You know, I feel terrible about Joey,

354
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:21,635
but it's a great
business opportunity.

355
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:21,844
but it's a great
business opportunity.

356
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:24,477
I don't even know how long
I'm gonna be away for.

357
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,710
Where will you stay?

358
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:27,910
An apartment complex.

359
00:11:27,944 --> 00:11:30,477
The, uh--
The Eiffel Towers.

360
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,677
Uh...

361
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,910
Like I said, uh,

362
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,044
you'll be getting
a postcard in a few days.

363
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:37,877
And again, I'm sorry.

364
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,077
George, you have no idea
how fantastic this is.

365
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,210
Fantastic?
Yeah.

366
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:47,910
We've been trying to reunite
Joey with his father,

367
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:50,310
who lives in Paris.

368
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:51,635
But he's afraid to
fly alone.

369
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:52,144
But he's afraid to
fly alone.

370
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:53,844
You know, he's
kind of withdrawn.

371
00:11:53,877 --> 00:11:56,544
But he seems to
take to you.

372
00:11:56,577 --> 00:11:58,144
So, it's a perfect
solution.

373
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:01,077
Gee. What a coincidence.
Yeah.

374
00:12:02,677 --> 00:12:04,377
And you'll send me
a postcard.

375
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:10,910
Helen really seemed
to respond to Renoir.

376
00:12:10,944 --> 00:12:12,044
I think she really
connected

377
00:12:12,077 --> 00:12:13,844
with the way
he painted children.

378
00:12:13,877 --> 00:12:15,177
Mm-hmm.

379
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,377
And that Morty...

380
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,144
I'll tell you, that
old guy's full of life.

381
00:12:20,177 --> 00:12:21,635
(LAUGHS)

382
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:21,710
(LAUGHS)

383
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:24,377
He was convinced
Monet was nearsighted.

384
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:26,910
I kept telling him.

385
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:28,210
Aaron?

386
00:12:29,821 --> 00:12:30,888
Yes?

387
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:33,155
Uh...let me ask you
a question.

388
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,521
How come you asked
Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld,

389
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,555
to go to the museum
with you?

390
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:40,855
Well, they were in
from out of town.

391
00:12:40,888 --> 00:12:43,021
I thought
they would enjoy it.

392
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,855
Uh-huh.

393
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:47,955
Um, you didn't feel
uncomfortable

394
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:50,221
spending the whole day
at the museum

395
00:12:50,255 --> 00:12:51,635
with two complete
strangers

396
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:51,788
with two complete
strangers

397
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:53,621
who are more than
twice your age?

398
00:12:53,655 --> 00:12:54,721
No.

399
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:58,321
It was fun.

400
00:12:58,355 --> 00:13:02,021
You had fun
with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld?

401
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:03,221
Yeah.

402
00:13:04,888 --> 00:13:06,821
They bought me a Coke.

403
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:12,888
How'd you come up with
the idea for the beltless trench coat?

404
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:14,455
I came home one night

405
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:17,621
and I tripped over
one of Jerry's toys.

406
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:20,788
So I took out my belt,
just to threaten him.

407
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:21,635
And I got a glimpse
of myself in the mirror.

408
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,755
And I got a glimpse
of myself in the mirror.

409
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:26,955
How serendipitous.

410
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:29,188
So, that night,
I cut off the loops,

411
00:13:29,221 --> 00:13:31,621
and the Executive was born.
Mm.

412
00:13:31,655 --> 00:13:33,988
He also came up with an idea
for a brimless rain hat,

413
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,788
but that never materialized.

414
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:38,455
All right, come on.
Let's play.

415
00:13:38,488 --> 00:13:39,888
Did you call
Jack Klompus yet?

416
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:41,155
I haven't been able
to reach him.

417
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,688
I'll call him right now.
Come on.

418
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,621
Just a second.

419
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:46,621
Jerry, have you seen
<i>Schindler's List?</i>

420
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:47,888
No, I haven't
seen it yet.

421
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:48,988
Oh, you have to go.
You have to.

422
00:13:49,021 --> 00:13:50,055
I'm going.

423
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:51,588
You have to.
Okay.

424
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:54,721
Hello, Jack?
<i>Yeah?</i>

425
00:13:54,755 --> 00:13:55,955
Jack, it's Morty.

426
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:57,321
Who died?

427
00:13:58,388 --> 00:13:59,688
Nobody died.

428
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:02,188
Jack, I want you
to do me a big favor.

429
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:04,455
In my garage there are
a couple of boxes.

430
00:14:04,488 --> 00:14:05,521
What boxes?

431
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:07,321
I'm gonna explain
what boxes.

432
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:09,488
All right.
How the hell do I know?

433
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:12,288
Anyway, there are these
three big boxes. You can't miss them.

434
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:14,788
I want you to ship them here
to New York for me.

435
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,321
I thought you were
going to Paris.

436
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,155
I'm still going to Paris.

437
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:19,988
I got a big deal
cooking here.

438
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:21,488
What's in the boxes?

439
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:21,635
Raincoats.
<i>Raincoats?</i>

440
00:14:21,635 --> 00:14:24,121
Raincoats.
<i>Raincoats?</i>

441
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,555
You think you're
gonna sell those old, crappy raincoats?

442
00:14:27,588 --> 00:14:28,721
That's garbage.

443
00:14:28,755 --> 00:14:29,888
HELEN:
I guarantee you,

444
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:32,055
Doris is not letting him
mail those boxes.

445
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,455
When do you want these?

446
00:14:33,488 --> 00:14:34,521
Send them tomorrow.

447
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:37,288
ESTELLE:
So...

448
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:38,988
you think they're
coming tonight?

449
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:41,055
I don't know.
They said maybe.

450
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,221
Of course they're coming.
They're leaving soon.

451
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:44,955
If they don't come tonight,
they might not see us.

452
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:46,288
Well, they better come.

453
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:48,721
I got all this paella.

454
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,635
I admire Morty and Helen
going to France.

455
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:52,321
I admire Morty and Helen
going to France.

456
00:14:53,188 --> 00:14:55,221
We should take a trip.

457
00:14:55,255 --> 00:14:56,821
Maybe a cruise.

458
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:59,021
Yes, a cruise.

459
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:01,021
A long cruise.

460
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:02,455
Just the two of you.

461
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:03,988
Georgie,
what were you doing,

462
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:06,188
poking around the attic
last night?

463
00:15:08,155 --> 00:15:09,488
I...

464
00:15:09,521 --> 00:15:10,688
I wasn't in the attic.

465
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:12,255
I heard noise.

466
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:14,788
Maybe it was a mouse.

467
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:16,521
Okay, that's it!
We're moving!

468
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:17,955
What?

469
00:15:17,988 --> 00:15:20,188
I will not tolerate
infestation.

470
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:21,635
You haven't even seen one.

471
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:23,288
You haven't even seen one.

472
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:26,455
Don't you understand?
The very thought, the very idea.

473
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:28,288
I'll never be
comfortable again.

474
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:29,988
All right, Frank,
that's enough.

475
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:37,655
GEORGE:
I guess I've been hanging onto them

476
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,555
for so long,
because...

477
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:41,988
I just couldn't
accept the fact

478
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:43,755
that Dad was really
gone forever.

479
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:47,188
Uh-huh.

480
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:49,021
They will get a good home,
won't they?

481
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:50,121
Look, I gotta be
honest with you.

482
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:51,621
There's nothing here
too spectacular.

483
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:53,021
Oh, I beg to
differ.

484
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:57,855
My father took great pride
in his appearance.

485
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:00,388
He was a very
handsome man. A Casanova, really.

486
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:02,655
I'll give you $200
for the three boxes.

487
00:16:04,155 --> 00:16:05,488
Could you make it 225?

488
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:07,388
That was his high game
in bowling.

489
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:11,121
Yeah, I'm in
a good mood. Here.

490
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:12,455
Thank you.

491
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:14,855
Hey...George.
What are you doing here?

492
00:16:14,888 --> 00:16:18,121
Uh, I'm just selling
some of Dad's things.

493
00:16:18,155 --> 00:16:20,555
That's what he would
have wanted.

494
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:21,635
Oh. I got you.

495
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:22,221
Oh. I got you.

496
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:25,321
That'll do.

497
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:27,555
Oh, hey, guess what.
Morty Seinfeld and I

498
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:29,788
are going into business
together selling raincoats.

499
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:30,955
Hey, that's swell.

500
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:32,955
We worked it all out
over dinner last night.

501
00:16:32,988 --> 00:16:34,121
Dinner?
What?

502
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:36,321
You...had dinner
with the Seinfelds?

503
00:16:36,355 --> 00:16:38,021
Yeah, last night.

504
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:39,721
Was this something
you had planned for a while?

505
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:41,888
No, it was
spur of the moment.

506
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:43,321
Well, you--
You know Morty.

507
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:45,921
He likes to fly by the seat
of his vintage pants.

508
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:48,955
They had plans.
They had plans!

509
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:51,635
Ooh. Boy, I've never
seen these before.

510
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,188
Ooh. Boy, I've never
seen these before.

511
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:53,355
They just came in.

512
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,821
Part of my springtime
cruise collection.

513
00:16:56,755 --> 00:16:57,855
Two for $25.

514
00:16:57,888 --> 00:17:00,288
Oh, I'll take these. Yeah.
All right.

515
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:02,455
Hey, remember
this raincoat that you sold me?

516
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,888
Sure. That's the Executive.
Uh-huh.

517
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:05,055
Do you have any others?

518
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:07,488
I wish. They don't
make them anymore. Come here.

519
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:09,988
Suppose I told you
I have 50 in mint condition.

520
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:11,121
You interested?
Very interested.

521
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,788
They're coming in
from Florida.

522
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:14,621
Bring them in.
So, you'll buy them?

523
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:16,755
I don't see what would
possibly stop me.

524
00:17:26,982 --> 00:17:28,982
Ahhh, hahhh.

525
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:30,116
Aha!

526
00:17:31,782 --> 00:17:33,582
They had plans, huh?
They were busy.

527
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:36,849
They were busy
with their big plans, huh?

528
00:17:36,882 --> 00:17:37,916
What are you
talking about?

529
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:39,016
Mom and Pop Seinfeld.

530
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:40,249
Look, I don't know.

531
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:41,482
I know what they did
last night.

532
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:42,616
They had dinner with Kramer.

533
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:44,849
Oh, they were tired.
It was a last-minute thing.

534
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:46,416
They don't wanna have dinner
with my parents?

535
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:47,849
That's right.

536
00:17:47,882 --> 00:17:48,816
Something wrong
with my parents? Absolutely.

537
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:50,916
They're wonderful people.

538
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:51,082
The same people
you currently live with?

539
00:17:51,082 --> 00:17:52,482
The same people
you currently live with?

540
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:53,649
Yes!

541
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:56,016
Uh-huh.

542
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:57,249
So, are they coming tonight?

543
00:17:57,282 --> 00:17:59,816
I don't know what
their plans are.

544
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:01,216
Okay. Fine.

545
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,249
It's going to be
very interesting.

546
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:07,316
Very interesting
if they don't show up tonight.

547
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:10,016
You know, my mother
made all this paella.

548
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:11,849
What is that, anyway?

549
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,349
It's a Spanish dish.

550
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:17,082
It's a melange of fish
and meat with rice.

551
00:18:17,116 --> 00:18:18,182
Very tasty.

552
00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:19,416
All right.
I'll tell them.

553
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:20,749
Could you do
one other thing for me?

554
00:18:20,782 --> 00:18:21,082
Name it.

555
00:18:21,082 --> 00:18:22,116
Name it.

556
00:18:22,149 --> 00:18:23,916
Would your parents
have any objections

557
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:26,716
to taking a little kid
to Paris with them?

558
00:18:31,216 --> 00:18:35,249
It turns out that the kid's
father lives in Paris.

559
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,949
Is that a coincidence?

560
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,182
Alec wants me
to take him over there.

561
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:41,782
So I figure as long as
they're going--

562
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:45,249
You thought as long as
they're mailing postcards,

563
00:18:45,282 --> 00:18:47,282
it wouldn't be too much
to ask my parents

564
00:18:47,316 --> 00:18:49,649
to drag a child
who they've never seen

565
00:18:49,682 --> 00:18:51,082
through the streets of Paris?

566
00:18:51,082 --> 00:18:51,882
through the streets of Paris?

567
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:54,182
If you think
it's too much,

568
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,449
they don't have to
mail the postcards.

569
00:18:58,982 --> 00:19:01,749
So, where's
he taking you?

570
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:04,916
First, we're going to
a matinee. I'm taking the afternoon off.

571
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:06,749
We're gonna go see
<i>My Fair Lady.</i>

572
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:09,582
And then we're gonna
go to dinner.

573
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,249
He knows all these
fantastic places.

574
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:13,682
You are one lucky girl.

575
00:19:14,616 --> 00:19:17,016
Wish I could find a nice guy.

576
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:18,182
Oh. Hi, Aaron.

577
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:19,782

578

Hello, Elaine.

582
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,449
(LAUGHTER)

583
00:19:33,116 --> 00:19:35,782
I was able to finagle
two more tickets to <i>My Fair Lady,</i>

584
00:19:35,816 --> 00:19:38,649
and I thought, why not ask
Morty and Helen?

585
00:19:40,116 --> 00:19:41,249
Great.

586
00:19:41,282 --> 00:19:42,649
This is some
office.

587
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,649
What's the square
footage?

588
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:46,449
You don't mind,
do you, Elaine?

589
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:48,416
Mind? Oh,
of course not.

590
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:51,082
We can make
a whole day of it.

591
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:51,149
We can make
a whole day of it.

592
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:52,782
This is some
building.

593
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:55,182
Harry Fleming
used to have an office here.

594
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:57,816
There was a deli
on the first floor.

595
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:01,249
You don't get corned beef
like that anymore.

596
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:03,249
What happened to that deli?

597
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:05,182

When did you get
tickets to see that?

651
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:58,516

00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:40,282
I could buy and sell him,
like that.

704
00:23:40,316 --> 00:23:42,182
The hell with them!

705
00:23:42,216 --> 00:23:45,616
The thing that bothers me
the most is the lying.

706
00:23:46,782 --> 00:23:48,416
Well, let's forget
about it.

707
00:23:48,449 --> 00:23:50,816
We're going on
a beautiful vacation.

708
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:52,616
Vacation?

709
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:56,082
Your mother and I are
planning on taking a cruise.

710
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:57,582
Ohh!

711
00:23:57,616 --> 00:23:59,782
But I can't find any of
my vacation clothes.

712
00:23:59,816 --> 00:24:02,282
There were in the attic.

713
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,816
The attic?

714
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:06,416
You haven't worn any
of those clothes for years.

715
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:09,116
How can I go on a cruise
without my cabana-wear?

716
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:10,949
I love those--
Those clothes.

717
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,049
Aah! A mouse!
I saw a mouse!

718
00:24:14,949 --> 00:24:16,549
It's the remote.

719
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:20,949
Where the hell
are my clothes?

720
00:24:20,982 --> 00:24:21,082
I love
those clothes.

721
00:24:21,082 --> 00:24:22,616
I love
those clothes.

722
00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:25,282
Lousy, moth-ridden
crap.

723
00:24:28,682 --> 00:24:31,482
I'm not crazy
about used clothes.

724
00:24:31,516 --> 00:24:33,149
I mean, they call it
vintage, you know,

725
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:34,749
to take your mind off
of what it really is--

726
00:24:34,782 --> 00:24:36,749
nasty-wear.

727
00:24:36,782 --> 00:24:39,682
"Oh, it's clean.
People wear underwear."

728
00:24:39,716 --> 00:24:42,249
Yeah, well, they don't
wear iron underwear.

729
00:24:42,282 --> 00:24:43,482
And that's what
it's gonna take

730
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:46,016
to get me
in those clothes.

731
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:47,449
I mean, I'll move
into an apartment

732
00:24:47,482 --> 00:24:48,949
after a strange person
moves out.

733
00:24:48,982 --> 00:24:51,082
Why would I want to move
into somebody's pants?

734
00:24:51,082 --> 00:24:52,982
Why would I want to move
into somebody's pants?

735
00:24:53,016 --> 00:24:55,749
There is no vintage
underwear, of course.

736
00:24:55,782 --> 00:24:58,249
But it's not because a guy
couldn't sell his underwear.

737
00:24:58,282 --> 00:25:00,249
It's because men
wear their underwear

738
00:25:00,282 --> 00:25:03,249
until it absolutely
disintegrates.

739
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:05,116
Men hang onto underwear

740
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:09,649
until each
individual underwear molecule is so strained,

741
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:12,616
it can barely retain
the properties of a solid.

742
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:15,149
It actually becomes
underwear vapor.

743
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,082
We don't even throw it out.

744
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:18,249
We just open a window,

745
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:20,749
and it goes out
like dandelion spores.

746
00:25:20,782 --> 00:25:21,082
That's how men
throw out underwear.

747
00:25:21,082 --> 00:25:22,016
That's how men
throw out underwear.

748
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:23,116
We just go--
(BLOWS)

749
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:25,116
And it's gone.
That's it.

750
00:25:32,716 --> 00:25:34,716
(MOVIE DIALOGUE
IN GERMAN)

751
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,770
Hey.
MORTY: Hey, Jerry.

752
00:26:00,803 --> 00:26:01,864
So, how was
the movie?

753
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:04,579
Oh. Really
good.

754
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,019
Really good.

755
00:26:06,053 --> 00:26:08,494
Didn't the three hours
go by just like that?

756
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:09,627
Like that.

757
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,094
What about the end,
with the list?

758
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,427
Yeah, that
was some list.

759
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,360
What'd you think of
the black and white?

760
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,994
The black and white?

761
00:26:20,027 --> 00:26:21,894
The whole movie was in
black and white.

762
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:25,627
Oh, yeah.
I didn't even realize.

763
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,760
You don't even
think about it.

764
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:26,942
There's so much
going on.

765
00:26:26,942 --> 00:26:28,294
There's so much
going on.

766
00:26:28,327 --> 00:26:30,227
Yeah. Yeah.

767
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,294
I tell you,
I could see it again.

768
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:37,870
So, Klompus has
the key, but the jerk couldn't open it up.

769
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:40,670
All you got to do
is jiggle it.

770
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:43,703
You just get
it in there, jiggle it, jiggle it.

771
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:46,436
Look, I find this whole
thing very uninteresting.

772
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,736
When you get
the coats, come in.

773
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,470
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hey, I'm on your side. Yeah, yeah.

774
00:26:50,403 --> 00:26:52,003
Hey. What, again?

775
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:54,436
I'm trying to buy
some of the clothes back.

776
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,236
Hey, you want to come over
for dinner tonight?

777
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:56,942
My mother made
all this extra paella.

778
00:26:56,942 --> 00:26:58,170
My mother made
all this extra paella.

779
00:26:58,203 --> 00:27:00,836
Paella? Yeah,
I'll be there.

780
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,503
Apparently, the Seinfelds
are too good for us.

781
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:06,770
I shouldn't say anything
bad about your partner.

782
00:27:06,803 --> 00:27:10,203
No, we're not really partners.
I only get 25 percent.

783
00:27:10,236 --> 00:27:13,103
Twenty-five percent?
It was your idea.

784
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:14,336
Yeah, I know.

785
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,703
You're doing
all the legwork.

786
00:27:15,736 --> 00:27:16,836
That's right.

787
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,236
He's ripping you off.

788
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,703
You're right!
He's ripping me off.

789
00:27:19,736 --> 00:27:21,703
If anybody should be
getting more, it's you.

790
00:27:21,736 --> 00:27:23,270
He's ripping me off!

791
00:27:23,303 --> 00:27:24,870
Don't let him
take advantage of you like that.

792
00:27:24,903 --> 00:27:25,970
Aah!

793
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,670
Oh, it's you.

794
00:27:30,703 --> 00:27:32,636
You're the one
who sold me the moth-ridden cabana crap.

795
00:27:36,103 --> 00:27:38,270
You know,
I've been thinking.

796
00:27:38,303 --> 00:27:40,536
Why is Kramer
getting 25 percent?

797
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,103
Well, he told you
about the place.

798
00:27:42,136 --> 00:27:44,236
So what?
Why is that worth 25 percent?

799
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,236
It's a finder's fee.
You know what a finder's fee is?

800
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,236
You find something,
you get a fee.

801
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,536
A finder's fee is
10 percent, no more.

802
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,603
Well, it's
too late now.

803
00:27:53,636 --> 00:27:56,503
Those are my coats.
I saved them, I stored them.

804
00:27:56,536 --> 00:27:56,942
I've been waiting years
for this payoff.

805
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:58,203
I've been waiting years
for this payoff.

806
00:27:58,236 --> 00:28:00,803
Well, you're not
gonna say anything. Hm.

807
00:28:03,536 --> 00:28:05,236
I've been thinking
about something.

808
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,570
Yeah. So have I.
Ah!

809
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,036
I don't think
the deal is fair.

810
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,503
You don't think it's fair?
No. No. No.

811
00:28:09,536 --> 00:28:11,670
I found the place.
I set the whole thing up.

812
00:28:11,703 --> 00:28:12,836
I'm doing all the legwork.

813
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,003
What legwork?

814
00:28:14,036 --> 00:28:15,170
Oh, there's legwork.

815
00:28:15,203 --> 00:28:16,836
If anything, you're
getting too much.

816
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,936
Too much?

817
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,436
That's right.
They're my coats.

818
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,170
Okay, look, I want
35 percent.

819
00:28:21,203 --> 00:28:22,770
I'm thinking
more like 15.

820
00:28:22,803 --> 00:28:24,403
No way
I'm taking 15.

821
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,270
Well, you're not
getting 35!

822
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:26,942
All right, let's
compromise.

823
00:28:26,942 --> 00:28:28,370
All right, let's
compromise.

824
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:29,503
Twenty-five
percent.

825
00:28:29,536 --> 00:28:30,936
Okay,
it's a deal.

826
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:34,570
RUDY
Moths are the scourge of my business.

827
00:28:34,603 --> 00:28:36,370
All it takes is
one moth to lay eggs.

828
00:28:36,403 --> 00:28:37,836
You know what happens
to the larvae?

829
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,503
They hatch
and they're everywhere.

830
00:28:39,536 --> 00:28:41,270
Well, I'm--
I'm sorry.

831
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,603
Here's your money back.

832
00:28:42,636 --> 00:28:44,003
And I'll take the clothes.

833
00:28:44,036 --> 00:28:46,770
This will hardly
put a dent in my fumigation bill.

834
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:48,736
So, uh, where are
the clothes?

835
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,403
I burned them.

836
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:52,236
Oh. That's good.

837
00:28:55,103 --> 00:28:56,942
ELAINE:
Now, I know they're your parents, Jerry,

838
00:28:56,942 --> 00:28:57,236
ELAINE:
Now, I know they're your parents, Jerry,

839
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,170
and they're
very nice people.

840
00:28:59,203 --> 00:29:03,836
But don't you think
it's odd that a 35-year-old man

841
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,770
is going to
these lengths

842
00:29:05,803 --> 00:29:07,836
to see that someone
else's parents are enjoying themselves?

843
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,136
Don't you find that
abnormal?

844
00:29:10,936 --> 00:29:12,636
It is a tad askew.

845
00:29:14,603 --> 00:29:17,003
I mean, they're your parents,
and you don't do anything.

846
00:29:17,036 --> 00:29:18,670
So, why is this stranger
doing it?

847
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:20,070
I've hardly been out
to dinner with them.

848
00:29:20,103 --> 00:29:22,870
See? And I can't even
say anything.

849
00:29:22,903 --> 00:29:25,203
Because all he's really
doing is being nice.

850
00:29:25,236 --> 00:29:26,942
But nobody is
this nice.

851
00:29:26,942 --> 00:29:27,170
But nobody is
this nice.

852
00:29:27,203 --> 00:29:30,403
This is like
certifiably nice.

853
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,203
You're right.
He's insane.

854
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:35,570
Yes. He's insane.
That's what I think.

855
00:29:35,603 --> 00:29:36,670
So, what are you
gonna do?

856
00:29:36,703 --> 00:29:37,736
I don't know.

857
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,836
I don't know
what to do.

858
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,570
Oh, God.
So, how was the movie?

859
00:29:42,603 --> 00:29:45,936
Uh, from what I saw,
it was pretty good.

860
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,670
Yeah, what do you mean
"from what you saw"?

861
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:48,770
Well, I, uh--

862
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:51,536
I didn't actually
get to see the whole movie.

863
00:29:52,236 --> 00:29:54,503
Yeah? Why not?

864
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:56,942
I was, kind of, um...
making out.

865
00:29:56,942 --> 00:29:57,870
I was, kind of, um...
making out.

866
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:05,103
You were making out
during <i>Schindler's List?</i>

867
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,203
I couldn't help it.

868
00:30:07,236 --> 00:30:08,670
We hadn't been alone
in a long time.

869
00:30:08,703 --> 00:30:10,003
It just got
the better of me.

870
00:30:10,036 --> 00:30:11,336
During
<i>Schindler's List?</i>

We're both living
with our parents.

872
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,870
Did anybody see you?
Did anyone say anything?

873
00:30:14,903 --> 00:30:16,736
No, I don't think so.

874
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,270
I saw Newman
as I was leaving, but he didn't see me.

875
00:30:17,303 --> 00:30:18,236
Oh.

876
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,003
Hello, Mrs. Seinfeld.

Hello, Newman.

878
00:30:34,703 --> 00:30:36,236
Jerry's not here.

879
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,703
Uh, uh...
having a nice trip?

880
00:30:40,536 --> 00:30:43,370
Wonderful.
We went to the theater last night.

881
00:30:43,403 --> 00:30:45,403
Oh, the theater.

882
00:30:45,436 --> 00:30:46,903
Because I
was wondering...

883
00:30:46,936 --> 00:30:48,836
Wondering what?

884
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,603
Why I didn't see you
at <i>Schindler's List</i> with Jerry.

885
00:30:50,636 --> 00:30:52,070
Well, we already saw it.

886
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:54,003
Oh, well, it's
a good thing

887
00:30:54,036 --> 00:30:55,703
for Jerry that
you didn't go.

888
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:56,942
Why is that?

889
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:57,436
Why is that?

890
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:00,003
Well, he really
seemed to have his hands full,

891
00:31:00,036 --> 00:31:01,503
if you know
what I mean.

892
00:31:01,536 --> 00:31:03,270
I'm afraid I don't.

893
00:31:03,303 --> 00:31:05,103
Him and his buxom
little friend, Rachel,

894
00:31:05,136 --> 00:31:07,403
were going at it
pretty good in the balcony.

895
00:31:07,436 --> 00:31:09,070
What?

896
00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:10,670
What, do I have
to spell it out for you?

897
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:12,203
He was moving on her
like the stormtroopers into Poland.

898
00:31:13,936 --> 00:31:16,603
Jerry was necking
during <i>Schindler's List?</i>

899
00:31:16,636 --> 00:31:17,936
Yes!

900
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:22,270
And a more offensive
spectacle I cannot recall.

901
00:31:22,303 --> 00:31:25,503
Anyway, I just really
came up to get some detergent.

902
00:31:25,536 --> 00:31:26,942
Jerry sends
his laundry out.

903
00:31:26,942 --> 00:31:27,103

Oh, right.

905
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:30,603
Well, it was nice
seeing you folks.

906
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:33,436
And, oh, by the way,
you didn't hear this from me.

907
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,670
Ta-ta.

00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,536
Hi.

00:31:50,103 --> 00:31:51,203

What did I do?

911
00:31:52,103 --> 00:31:53,403
How could you?

912
00:31:53,436 --> 00:31:54,836
How could I
what?

913
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,942
You were making out
during <i>Schindler's List?</i>

No!

919
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,836
How could you do
such a thing?

920
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,270
I couldn't
help it!

921
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,003
We hadn't been alone
together in a long time!

922
00:32:12,036 --> 00:32:15,103
And we just started up
a little during the coming attractions.

923
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:17,803
And the next thing we knew,
the war was over!

<i>Oh, I got in.</i>

937
00:32:40,703 --> 00:32:43,070
I had to break the window
with a rock.

938
00:32:43,103 --> 00:32:46,670
And then I got my hand
all cut up reaching in.

939
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:48,403
You broke the window?

940

didn't you?

He should be on his hands and knees thanking you.

Did you send them?

00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:56,942
Yeah. They'll be there

I told you to
send them express!

00:33:06,703 --> 00:33:09,170
Well, it was $10 cheaper
in the afternoon

951
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:10,336
than the morning.

952
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,103

the difference?

about the window?

your window now?

We have to make
the flight.

We're with

use them?

Well, I suppose
they're wasted.

Yes, I suppose
they are.

Yes, I suppose
they are.

straight down to this Rudy

00:36:10,555 --> 00:36:11,444
Have you ever had
really good paella?

1047
00:36:11,477 --> 00:36:12,644
Not really.

1048
00:36:12,677 --> 00:36:15,011
Oh, it's an orgiastic
feast for the senses,

1049
00:36:15,044 --> 00:36:18,611
a wanton festival
of sights, sounds and colors.

1050
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:21,111
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1051
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:22,777
Hey, Dad, you sure
we're at the right carousel?

1052
00:36:22,811 --> 00:36:23,911
This is it.

1053
00:36:23,944 --> 00:36:25,077
So, how much
we gonna make, hm?

1054
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:26,244
Take it easy.

1055
00:36:26,277 --> 00:36:27,744
I've been through a million
of these negotiations.

1056
00:36:27,777 --> 00:36:29,244
What, 2000,
3000?

1057
00:36:29,277 --> 00:36:31,944
That's giving it away.
This is a one-of-a-kind item.

1058
00:36:31,977 --> 00:36:33,444
More?
More than 3000?

1059
00:36:33,477 --> 00:36:36,677
Just watch me do my thing.
Ha, ha, ha.

1060
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:38,744
Say, Dad,
isn't that one of yours?

1061
00:36:38,777 --> 00:36:40,555
Look at this.
Look how this idiot packed it.

1062
00:36:40,555 --> 00:36:41,477
Look at this.
Look how this idiot packed it.

1063
00:36:41,511 --> 00:36:43,611
He didn't tape it.
He just flipped the flaps.

1064
00:36:43,644 --> 00:36:45,477
Wait. Ho-hold it.

1065
00:36:46,477 --> 00:36:47,811
Kramer, you missed
a couple.

1066
00:36:47,844 --> 00:36:49,077
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1067
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:51,411
Welcome to the Gateway
to Paris charter flight.

1068
00:36:51,444 --> 00:36:53,144
Dad, isn't that
your charter group?

1069
00:36:53,977 --> 00:36:56,411
GEORGE:
Honesty, hard work.

1070
00:36:56,444 --> 00:36:58,911
These are the values
that I was raised with.

1071
00:36:58,944 --> 00:37:00,611
The most important
thing, Joey,

1072
00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:02,144
is to be able to look
yourself in the mirror

1073
00:37:02,177 --> 00:37:03,577
before you go to
sleep at night.

1074
00:37:03,611 --> 00:37:05,577
Hey, I got news for you,
four-eyes:

1075
00:37:05,611 --> 00:37:07,477
There's no way
you're staying with us in Paris.

1076
00:37:13,377 --> 00:37:14,477
FRANK:
You burned them?

1077
00:37:14,511 --> 00:37:16,077
Those clothes are
not yours to burn.

1078
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:17,144
Who are you anyways?

1079
00:37:17,177 --> 00:37:18,244
I'm the father.

1080
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,411
He said his father
was dead.

1081
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:20,577
He said I was dead?

1082
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:21,911
That's right.

1083
00:37:21,944 --> 00:37:24,111
Squeezed an extra
$25 out of me.

1084
00:37:24,144 --> 00:37:26,677
That's what my life
is worth to him, $25?

1085
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,077
Hey, Frank!

1086
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:29,911
Oh. Hey, I just want you
to know

1087
00:37:29,944 --> 00:37:31,677
that I'm retracting
that dinner invitation.

1088
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:34,177
Well, you don't
have to retract it, 'cause we never went.

1089
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,477
I'm retracting that
it was ever offered.

1090
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:38,411
I retract
your retraction.

1091
00:37:38,444 --> 00:37:40,555
What are you, trying to unload
some of that junk of yours?

1092
00:37:40,555 --> 00:37:40,911
What are you, trying to unload
some of that junk of yours?

1093
00:37:40,944 --> 00:37:42,077
Will you excuse me,
please?

1094
00:37:42,111 --> 00:37:43,511
We're conducting
business here.

1095
00:37:43,544 --> 00:37:45,177
Keep your raincoats.
I'm not interested.

1096
00:37:45,211 --> 00:37:46,444
I thought we had
a deal.

1097
00:37:46,477 --> 00:37:48,077
That's another one
of my shirts!

1098
00:37:48,111 --> 00:37:50,177
I'm not buying any more
clothes from anyone off the street.

1099
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:53,077
Who's off the street?
I'm in the raincoat business 35 years.

1100
00:37:53,111 --> 00:37:54,911
Maybe they have moths,
like his stuff.

1101
00:37:54,944 --> 00:37:56,744
My clothes
don't have moths!

1102
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:59,244
Because of his moths,
you're not buying my raincoats?

1103
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,411
That's right.

1104
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,444
(LAUGHS)
I'm all ticklish!

1105
00:38:07,477 --> 00:38:10,555
MAN (OVER PA):
<i>Flight 433 now boarding</i> <i>for Miami at gate 18-A.</i>

MAN (OVER PA):
<i>Flight 433 now boarding</i> <i>for Miami at gate 18-A.</i>

1107
00:38:11,977 --> 00:38:13,977
<i>Flight 433, now boarding.</i>

1108
00:38:14,611 --> 00:38:16,077
Okay, let's go.

1109
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:17,911
It was so nice of you
to come to the airport

1110
00:38:17,944 --> 00:38:19,244
to see us off.

1111
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:21,077
Are you sure
you can't stay a little longer?

1112
00:38:21,111 --> 00:38:22,277
No!
No!

1113
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:23,744
Goodbye.
Bye.

1114
00:38:23,777 --> 00:38:25,011
Bye-bye.
Take care.

1115
00:38:25,044 --> 00:38:26,077
Okay, Jer.
See ya.

1116
00:38:26,111 --> 00:38:27,844
Bye-bye, Elaine.
Bye-bye.

1117
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:32,911
We'll call you
when we get home.

1118
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:34,311
Thank you.

1119
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:35,744
I think
she meant me, but--

1120
00:38:35,777 --> 00:38:38,011
And make sure
Kramer uses good tape

1121
00:38:38,044 --> 00:38:39,244
when he sends
back the raincoats.

1122
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:40,311
Okay.

1123
00:38:40,344 --> 00:38:40,555
Bye.
Bye.

1124
00:38:40,555 --> 00:38:42,011
Bye.
Bye.

1125
00:38:42,777 --> 00:38:44,244
Aaron?

1126
00:38:44,277 --> 00:38:45,844
Aaron, are you
okay?

1127
00:38:45,877 --> 00:38:47,577
I could've
done more.

1128
00:38:47,611 --> 00:38:49,277
I could've done
so much more.

1129
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:51,611
You did enough.

1130
00:38:51,644 --> 00:38:54,777
No. I could've called
the travel agency,

1131
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:56,977
got them on another
flight to Paris.

1132
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:58,244
I could've got them out!

1133
00:38:58,277 --> 00:39:00,577
You tried, Aaron.
It was too expensive.

1134
00:39:00,611 --> 00:39:02,911
This watch.

1135
00:39:02,944 --> 00:39:05,777
This watch could've paid
for their whole trip.

1136
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:07,911
This ring...

1137
00:39:07,944 --> 00:39:09,744
This ring is
one more dinner

1138
00:39:09,777 --> 00:39:10,555
I could've taken
them out to.

1139
00:39:10,555 --> 00:39:11,611
I could've taken
them out to.

1140
00:39:12,877 --> 00:39:14,511
Water.

1141
00:39:14,544 --> 00:39:15,844
They need
some water.

1142
00:39:15,877 --> 00:39:17,077
Why?

1143
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:18,744
They'll get dehydrated
on the plane!

1144
00:39:18,777 --> 00:39:20,644
Get the Seinfelds
some water!

1145
00:39:20,677 --> 00:39:22,077
Please!

1146
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:23,311
Please!

1147
00:39:31,677 --> 00:39:33,611
Hi, Mr. Goldstein.
Is Rachel home?

1148
00:39:33,644 --> 00:39:36,011
I'm afraid Rachel's not going
to be able to see you tonight,

1149
00:39:36,044 --> 00:39:37,577
or any other night
for that matter.

1150
00:39:37,611 --> 00:39:38,611
Why? What did I do?

1151
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:40,177
You know very well.

1152
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:40,555
I heard about your behavior
at the movies the other night.

1153
00:39:40,555 --> 00:39:42,644
I heard about your behavior
at the movies the other night.

1154
00:39:42,677 --> 00:39:44,111
It was disgraceful.

1155
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:45,977
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

1156
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:47,844
I, for one, will not
allow my daughter to be involved

1157
00:39:47,877 --> 00:39:50,911
with someone of such
weak moral fiber.

1158
00:39:50,944 --> 00:39:54,111
Fortunately, my postman
happened to witness the entire incident.

1159
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:56,244
A heavyset fellow.
I believe he lives in your building.

1160
00:39:56,277 --> 00:39:57,811
(MOUTHS) Newman.
Now, if you don't mind.

1161
00:39:57,844 --> 00:39:58,977
Rachel.

1162
00:39:59,011 --> 00:40:00,211
Rachel.
Good night.

1163
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:03,777
JERRY:
So, my parents get home,

1164
00:40:03,811 --> 00:40:05,911
they open the door,
my father flicks the light on,

1165
00:40:05,944 --> 00:40:07,844
the whole place is
cleaned out...everything.

1166
00:40:07,877 --> 00:40:09,111
(GASPS)
Get out!

1167
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:10,555
How did that happen?

1168
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:11,744
How did that happen?

1169
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:13,344
The broken window.
Klompus never fixed it.

1170
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:14,744
They just walked right in.

1171
00:40:14,777 --> 00:40:17,411
Ohh boy.
They could use a vacation.

1172
00:40:17,444 --> 00:40:19,011
Yeah, they're taking one.

1173
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:21,577
The travel agent's trying
to set something else up for them.

1174
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:23,577
So, how about that Aaron?
(WHISTLES)

1175
00:40:23,611 --> 00:40:25,911
You know what drove me
crazy about him?

1176
00:40:25,944 --> 00:40:29,477
Did you ever notice that
he stood too close to you when he talked?

1177
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:30,644
No, I hadn't noticed.

1178
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:35,277
Pair of bear claws,
please.

1179
00:40:37,444 --> 00:40:39,011
Hi, Newman.

1180
00:40:39,544 --> 00:40:40,555
Hello, Jerry.

1181
00:40:40,555 --> 00:40:40,744
Hello, Jerry.

1182
00:40:40,777 --> 00:40:42,344
Say, I happened to
catch you

1183
00:40:42,377 --> 00:40:44,411
coming out of
<i>Schindler's List</i> the other night.

1184
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:46,744
Oh. Were you there?

1185
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,744
Yes, I was.

1186
00:40:48,777 --> 00:40:50,611
It's a pow--
It's a powerful film.

1187
00:40:50,644 --> 00:40:52,911
Yes. Shocking brutality,
don't you think?

1188
00:40:52,944 --> 00:40:54,011
Shocking.

1189
00:40:54,044 --> 00:40:55,411
Yeah, well,
that was nothing.

1190
00:40:55,444 --> 00:40:56,977
Jerry! Jerry!

Where the hell is your father?

00:41:08,977 --> 00:41:10,555
ESTELLE:
This is the best thing we ever did.

1194
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:11,144
ESTELLE:
This is the best thing we ever did.

1195
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,511
I just hope
those exterminators know what they're doing.

1196
00:41:13,544 --> 00:41:17,611
Ah, forget about them.
Let's just try and relax.

1197
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,611
Personal distance is
a very important thing.

1198
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:22,111
There's a new personal
distance, ATM distance.

1199
00:41:22,144 --> 00:41:23,677
When someone's
using an ATM,

1200
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:26,177
you want to be about
6 feet back, don't you?

1201
00:41:26,211 --> 00:41:28,611
People get a little edgy
around that ATM, don't they?

1202
00:41:28,644 --> 00:41:29,744
They got
their money out,

1203
00:41:29,777 --> 00:41:32,444
their eyes are darting
all around.

1204
00:41:32,477 --> 00:41:35,744
The other place I want to be
about 6 feet away is a urinal.

1205
00:41:35,777 --> 00:41:37,944
You want some
distance there too.

1206
00:41:37,977 --> 00:41:39,577
ATMs and urinals.

1207
00:41:39,611 --> 00:41:40,555
I guess whenever someone's
taking valuables out of their pants,

1208
00:41:40,555 --> 00:41:41,577
I guess whenever someone's
taking valuables out of their pants,

1209
00:41:41,611 --> 00:41:43,811
you want to give them
as much room as possible.
