that whole thing up.

When I shoo squirrels away,
I always say, "Get out of here."

ask her how those ball boys
get those jobs.

to do that.

of the car service

522
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:17,617
was so I wouldn't have to fight
the traffic on Friday night.

523
00:18:20,117 --> 00:18:21,284
I know, I'm late.

524
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:22,651
But hey, now I know
two signs:

525
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,417
"check" and "late."

526
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:27,084
Hey, this is my friend
you helped become the first ball man.

527
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:29,284
Ah.
Congratulations.

528
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,617
Uh, ah. Ah.

529
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:35,517
Hm?

530
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:40,451
She doesn't know what
she's talking about.

531
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:44,617
Guys!
You made it.

532
00:18:44,651 --> 00:18:46,117
Hey.

533
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:47,984
Hey, buddy.
Hey, Todd.

534
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:49,284
Sorry to hear about Gwen.

535
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:49,836
What? Why, did she say
something to you

536
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:51,084
What? Why, did she say
something to you

537
00:18:51,117 --> 00:18:52,384
about why she broke up
with me?

538
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:53,384
Oh, uh, no.

539
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:54,751
Tonight will be
the first chance

540
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:55,751
I've had to talk to her.

541
00:18:55,784 --> 00:18:57,551
Really. Heh.

542
00:18:57,584 --> 00:18:58,551
Look, George...

543
00:18:58,584 --> 00:18:59,784
I'm friends with
both of you,

544
00:18:59,817 --> 00:19:02,084
but I can't betray
her confidence

545
00:19:02,117 --> 00:19:04,417
by telling you
anything.

546
00:19:04,451 --> 00:19:06,584
I wouldn't
hear of it, Todd.

547
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:08,984
It's none of my business.

548
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:12,251
But you should try and find out
everything you possibly can.

549
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,051
In fact, I'll even stay

550
00:19:14,084 --> 00:19:16,451
all the way over on
the other side of the room

551
00:19:16,484 --> 00:19:19,817
just so there's no chance
of me overhearing anything.

552
00:19:19,851 --> 00:19:21,717
You are so centered.

553
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:23,217
Hey...

554
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:25,151
I've grown up.

555
00:19:25,184 --> 00:19:27,251
Oh, my God. There she is.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

556
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:29,217
Go. Heh.

557
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,717
[WHISPERING]
Let's go, let's go!

558
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:32,084
What?
Huh? Let's go!

559
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:35,084
Wh-what're
they saying?

560
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:39,651
"Hi, Gwen." "Hi, Tide."
High tide?

561
00:19:39,684 --> 00:19:40,684
"Hi, Todd."

562
00:19:41,984 --> 00:19:44,117
KRAMER:
"You got something between your teeth."

563
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:47,151
Where?
No, that's what <i>he</i> said.

564
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:49,836
"That's interesting.

565
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:49,884
"That's interesting.

566
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:51,717
"I love carrots,
but I hate carrot soup.

567
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:55,217
And I hate peas,
but I love pea soup."

568
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:56,217
So do I, huh?

569
00:19:56,251 --> 00:19:57,551
This is so wild.

570
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,651
Can I borrow her for a few hours
tomorrow afternoon?

571
00:19:59,684 --> 00:20:01,984
No. If I lend her to you,
I have to lend her to everybody.

572
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:03,117
I don't envy you,
Todd.

573
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:04,484
This place is gonna
be a mess.

574
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:06,917
Well, maybe you can stick around
after everybody leaves,

575
00:20:06,951 --> 00:20:07,984
and we can sweep together.

576
00:20:08,017 --> 00:20:09,951
"Why don't
you stick around,

577
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:12,151
and we can
sleep together?"

578
00:20:12,184 --> 00:20:13,151
What?!

579
00:20:13,184 --> 00:20:14,717
"You want me to
sleep with you?"

580
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:16,217
I don't wanna sweep alone.

581
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:17,817
He says, "I don't
wanna sleep alone."

582
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:19,117
And she says...

583
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:19,836
Oh, boy.

584
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:20,317
Oh, boy.

585
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,317
"Love to."

586
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:23,151
All right, that's it!

587
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:24,417
So you get rid of me,

588
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:26,484
and now the two of you
are gonna sleep together?!

589
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,117
What?
You're crazy!

590
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:29,951
KRAMER:
"What? You're crazy!"

591
00:20:29,984 --> 00:20:31,651
I heard
your whole conversation.

592
00:20:31,684 --> 00:20:33,351
How?

593
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:34,884
"How?"

594
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:36,651
I can read lips!

595
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:38,317
You said,
"Let's sleep together."

596
00:20:38,351 --> 00:20:41,817
No, I didn't. I said "sweep."
Let's <i>sweep</i> together.

597
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:44,284
GWEN & KRAMER:
You know like with a broom. Cleaning up!

598
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:45,284
Sweep?

599
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:47,384
GWEN & KRAMER:
Yes. Sweep.

600
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:48,384
Cut it.

601
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:49,751
George says, "Cut it."
Cut it!

602
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:49,836
KRAMER: George is saying--
Cut it.

603
00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:51,284
KRAMER: George is saying--
Cut it.

604
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,117
Would you stop signing?!

605
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,384
What?!

606
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:56,151
They said "sweep together,"
you idiots,

607
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:58,251
not "sleep together"!

608
00:20:59,284 --> 00:21:00,584
Look, I know
how to sign.

609
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:03,317
Ah! My eye! My eye!

610
00:21:04,951 --> 00:21:06,751
This is really amazing,

611
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:08,884
getting to see Monica Seles
play in the finals.

612
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:11,984
I know, and in the first
tournament of her comeback.

613
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:33,917
Thus ends the great
ball-man experiment.

614
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:44,917
You with
the tennis center?

615
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:46,784
Yeah.

616
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:49,551
Hey, how about that ball man
injuring Monica Seles?

617
00:21:49,584 --> 00:21:49,836
[CHUCKLES]
Wasn't that something?

Wasn't that something?

Oh.

621
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:07,584
I've always been a big fan
of the little check move.

[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

624
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:11,217
[WHISPERING]
Can I get the check?

625
00:22:11,251 --> 00:22:12,651
Check.

626
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:14,284
Unless the waiter's
not too sharp,

627
00:22:14,317 --> 00:22:15,551
they gotta total it up.

628
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,384
[MOUTHS]
<i>The check, I want the check.</i>

629
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:19,384
Sometimes they come over,

630
00:22:19,417 --> 00:22:21,584
"Do you want the check?"
"No, I wanna be pen pals.

631
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:23,451
"Can't you see
what I'm doing here?

and impress people."
