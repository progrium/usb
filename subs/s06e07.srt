my own suit.

180
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:38,300
I did it.
It's all done.

181
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:38,622
Hey!
I did it, huh?

182
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:39,566
Hey!
I did it, huh?

183
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,566
We're going out as soon
as she gets off of work.

184
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,233
And it'll still
be daytime.

185
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:45,866
I'm much better in the daytime
than at night. Less pressure.

186
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,633
I love the day date.

187
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,700
No wine, no shower.
There you go.

188
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,200
ELAINE:
So the trip was good?

189
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:54,400
Yes.

190
00:05:54,433 --> 00:05:56,533
Apart from that dreadful
airline food.

191
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:59,000
It wreaked absolute havoc
with my stomach.

192
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:01,066
You know, I have to say,

193
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,966
I've never admitted
this to anyone, but, um...

194
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,066
I kind of like airline food.

195
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,466
It's probably
because of...

[MUMBLES]

197
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:15,833
What?

198
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:17,000
What?

199
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, what?

200
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,566
[SIGHS]

201
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,033
What?

202
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:25,466
Where I come from,
we don't say "what."

203
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,700
It's proper
to say "pardon."

204
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,966
Oh, that should be...

[MUMBLES]

206
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,533
Pardon?

207
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:34,733
Nothing.

So then about a year ago I started selling

209
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:39,066
WAITRESS:
So then about a year ago I started selling

210
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,166
these funky little
hair clips.

211
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,633
It's going
pretty good.

212
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,333
I make them
in my apartment.

213
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:46,500
I'm just doing this
waitress thing for a while

214
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,400
because I wanted to go
to Europe this summer,

215
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:49,633
and I could use
a few extra--

216
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,166
Careful.

217
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,400
Oh, it's just
horse manure.

218
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:55,033
Horse manure's
not that bad.

219
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:57,133
I don't even mind
the word "manure."

220
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,466
You know, it's "newer,"
which is good,

221
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,066
and a "ma"
in front of it.

222
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,866
Ma-nure.

223
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,500
When you consider
the other choices,

224
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:06,166
<i>manure</i> is actually
pretty refreshing.

227
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,500
That's a nice watch,
George.

228
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:11,500
Yeah.

229
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:14,166
You know, my boyfriend
has the same one.

230
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,133
Huh, really?

231
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,800
Yeah, he loves
watches.

232
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,166
He's a real
watch freak.

233
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,400
Well, how about that.

234
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:21,666
Oh, look out.

235
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,800
You stepped
right in it.

236
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,433
Yes.
I sure did.

237
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,466
So you just pretended
it didn't bother you?

238
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,133
What is that,
boyfriend?

239
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,200
I don't
understand that.

240
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:34,566
What does she think
I asked her out for?

241
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,466
It's the way they just
slip it in there too.

242
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,833
Yeah.

243
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:38,622
Yeah. Like it's all just
part of the conversation.

244
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:41,066
Yeah. Like it's all just
part of the conversation.

245
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,233
"Oh, my boyfriend
really likes watches.

246
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:44,800
He's a real watch freak."

247
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,933
Well, that's fabulous.

248
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,333
Well, let me
ask you this.

249
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:52,733
What exactly did you say
when you asked her out?

250
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:55,466
I said, "Would you like to go
for a walk or something?"

251
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,333
Oh, a walk.
Well...

252
00:07:57,366 --> 00:07:58,666
Or something!

253
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,933
I said, "Or something."

254
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,733
"Or something."

255
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:05,033
Yeah, that's a date.

256
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:06,900
There you go.

257
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:08,622
Of course, you know, there is
always the possibility

258
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:09,166
Of course, you know, there is
always the possibility

259
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,400
that she called an audible.

260
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:11,533
What do you mean?

261
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:13,133
If she got up to
the line of scrimmage,

262
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,733
didn't like the looks
of the defense,

263
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:16,433
and changed the play.

264
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,866
I think things
were going okay.

265
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,700
We were having
a nice conversation.

266
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:23,700
Uh-huh.

267
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,733
I mentioned how
I liked horse manure.

268
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:28,833
You did.

269
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:30,266
Yeah.
Yeah.

270
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:33,500
You said you
liked horse manure?

271
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:35,733
Yeah.

272
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,533
You know, about how when
you break it down,

273
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:38,622
it's really
a very positive thing.

274
00:08:38,622 --> 00:08:39,533
it's really
a very positive thing.

275
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:43,200
You know, you have a "newer"
with a "ma" in front of it.

276
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:45,366
Ma-nure.

277
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,566
It's not bad.

278
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,033
And it was around
this point

279
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:50,533
that she mentioned
the boyfriend.

280
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:51,600
Yeah.

281
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,333
Oh, you think because of what
I said about the manure?

282
00:08:57,366 --> 00:09:00,000
I was just saying how it
takes a negative thing

283
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:01,366
and puts a positive
spin on it.

284
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,733
I'm just saying
there's a chance

285
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:05,200
she may not
have been enamored

286
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:08,233
with your thoughts
and feelings on manure.

287
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:08,622
So you don't think she
really has a boyfriend?

288
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:10,533
So you don't think she
really has a boyfriend?

289
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:11,533
My honest opinion?

290
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:12,666
I think she made it up.

291
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:15,900
Then she's just a liar,
isn't she?

292
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:17,366
Hey.

293
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,966
Hey.

294
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,866
Ah, you want something to eat,
don't you?

295
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,500
Oh, no, no, no.
You got me all wrong, buddy.

296
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:25,533
I am loving this
no refrigerator.

297
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,000
You know what
I discovered?

298
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,733
I really like depriving
myself of things.

299
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:30,800
It's fun.

300
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,533
Very monastic.

301
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:33,966
Well, what do you eat?

302
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,166
It's all fresh.

303
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,333
Fresh fish, fresh foul,
fresh fruit.

304
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:38,333
I buy it.
Mmmmm!

305
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:38,622
I eat it.

306
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:39,966
I eat it.

307
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,200
I'm glad it's
working out.

308
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, yeah.
It's working out.

309
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:47,500
And I got a date with that
waitress who works at Reggie's.

310
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:50,000
Boy, if I could meet a hostess,
we could open up our own place.

311
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:51,500
Ha, ha.

312
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:53,733
Yeah. Well, I'll tell you,
she's a full-figured gal.

313
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:54,833
Is she?

314
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:57,533
Oh, you better believe it,
buddy.

315
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:59,300
Hey, George, we could
double sometime.

316
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we could.

317
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,300
You know, Kramer,
the next time you talk to her,

318
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,866
find out if she knows
Kelly from Monk's.

319
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,800
I wanna know if she
really has a boyfriend.

maybe I can get

327
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,333
Yeah, you wanna
get that meal, don't ya?

328
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:32,400
How about Mendy's.

Ooh. Ever been there?

No, I haven't.

All right.

334
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,100
Yeah, I really needed
that suit.

KENNY:
I start off with curls.

336
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:46,233
That's good for the bicep.

337
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:48,566
I do 10 reps, two sets.

338
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,200
That's fantastic.

339
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,466
You work out
with weights?

340
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,966
No, I don't.
You should.

341
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,366
Why?

342
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,000
You worn the suit yet?

343
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:02,566
No, not yet.

344
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,000
Have you decided?

345
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:05,733
Oh, get
the swordfish.

346
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:08,033
Best swordfish
in the city.

347
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:08,622
The best, Jerry.

348
00:11:08,622 --> 00:11:09,233
The best, Jerry.

349
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:11,666
I'll have the salmon.

350
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,900
And you?

351
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:14,300
Uh, you know what I think?

352
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,366
I'm just gonna have soup.

353
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,200
Yeah, I'll save the meal
for another time.

354
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,200
Another time?

355
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:26,666
What other time?

356
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,566
I had a hot dog earlier.
I'm not that hungry.

357
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:32,366
No, no, Bania, no.

358
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,366
This is the dinner.

359
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,866
The soup counts.

360
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,200
Soup's not a meal.

361
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,633
You're supposed
to buy me a meal.

362
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,066
I'm not stopping
you from eating.

363
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,866
Go ahead and eat.
Get anything you want.

364
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,333
I don't want
anything but soup.

365
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:51,633
Then that's the meal.

366
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,800
But I had the hot dog.

367
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,233
I didn't tell you
to have a hot dog.

368
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:55,533
Who told you
to have a hot dog?

369
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:58,400
Hey, I give you
a brand-new Armani suit,

370
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:00,266
and you won't even
buy me a meal.

371
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,200
All right.
Fine.

372
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,200
Get the soup!

373
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,166
JERRY:
So he just gets soup.

374
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,633
He wants
to save the meal.

375
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,333
So now I gotta do
it all over again.

376
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,566
What kind of soup
did he get?

377
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,666
I don't know.

378
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,400
Consommé or something.

379
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:20,400
Consommé.

380
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:22,000
Hm.
What?

381
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,166
Well, that's really
not a meal, Jerry.

382
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,200
I mean, if he had gotten
chicken gumbo or matzo ball,

383
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:30,800
even mushroom barley,
then I would agree with you.

384
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,533
Those are very hearty soups.

385
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:34,466
Elaine, you're missing
the whole point.

386
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,800
What?

387
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,666
The meal is the act
of sitting down with him.

388
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,622
It doesn't matter
what you get.

389
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:39,333
It doesn't matter
what you get.

390
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:42,333
As long as he's sitting in
that restaurant, it's a meal.

391
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:44,066
Was it a cup or a bowl?

392
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,700
You see, again--

393
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:46,866
I'm just curious.

394
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,466
A bowl, okay?

395
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,600
Did he crumble
any crackers in it?

396
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,466
Did he crumble
any crackers in it?

397
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,333
As a matter of fact,
he did.

398
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:59,666
Oh, well,
crackers in bowl.

399
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,400
That-- That could be a meal.

to my aunt Sylvia here.

Look at this.

567
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:27,636

"No egg-white omelets."

568

an egg-white omelet?

It's a salad, only bigger,

583
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:53,836

584
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:57,636
I can bring you
two small salads.

585

in a big bowl?

that could happen?

someone else fired?

604
