1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,733
Yes, I'm a very lazy eater.

2
00:00:03,766 --> 00:00:05,166
I like--
That's why I like soup.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,733
First of all, it looks
half-digested

4
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:07,900
when they put it down.

5
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:10,333
So you feel like half the work
is done already.

6
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:11,700
I'm hoping Campbell's comes out

7
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:13,066
with, like, an IV line of soup,

8
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,900
so you could just jam
right into your arm, you know?

9
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,466
Campbell's tomato intravenous.

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,400
Mainline gumbo.

11
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:23,200
Everyone just sitting around
at dinner with their soup IV

12
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:25,033
just hanging on the hook there,
you know?

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,000
"How's yours, Grandpa?"

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,166
"How's yours, Grandpa?"

15
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,733
Oh, chunky style.

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,700

17
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:38,800
GEORGE:
All right, so,

18
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,533
what theater do you wanna
go to tonight?

19
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:43,633
We got 61st and 3rd,
or 84th and Broadway.

20
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,666
Which one you wanna go to,
Schmoopie?

21
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,666
You called me "Schmoopie."
You're Schmoopie.

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,366
You're Schmoopie.
You're Schmoopie.

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
You're Schmoopie.

24
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,066
All right, Schmoopies...

25
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,333
what's it gonna be?

26
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:56,366
Pick a theater.

27
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,633
Ah, we'll go to 3rd Avenue.

28
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,866
So can you come with us
for lunch to the soup place?

29
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,333
No, you have
a good lunch.

30
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:03,133
I'll meet you back here
for the movie.

31
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:03,951
Hey.
Hey.

32
00:01:03,951 --> 00:01:04,133
Hey.
Hey.

33
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,166
Hi, Elaine.

34
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,366
Hi, Sheila.

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,100
All right, then,
I'll see you later.

36
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,233
Bye, Schmoopie.
Bye, Schmoopie.

37
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,400
Okay. We ready
to go?

38
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:17,866
Yes, please.
Please, let's go.

39
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:20,666
I'm in the mood
for a cheeseburger.

40
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,166
No, we gotta go
to the soup place.

41
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,866
What soup place?
There's a soup stand.

42
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,500
Kramer's been
going there.

43
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:27,666
He's always raving.
I finally got a chance to go

44
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,333
there the other day,
and I tell you this:

45
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:30,833
You will be stunned.

46
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:32,333
Stunned by soup?

47
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:33,951
You can't eat this soup
standing up.

48
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:34,066
You can't eat this soup
standing up.

49
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,333
Your knees buckle.
Huh. All right.

50
00:01:36,366 --> 00:01:37,333
Let's go. Come on.

51
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:39,333
There's only one caveat.

52
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:40,466
The guy who runs
the place

53
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,666
is a little
temperamental.

54
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,333
Especially about
the ordering procedure.

55
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:47,700
He's secretly referred to
as the "Soup Nazi."

56
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,800
Why? What happens if you
don't order right?

57
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,633
He yells, and you don't
get your soup. What?

58
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:55,133
Just follow the ordering
procedure, and you will be fine.

59
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,666
All right, let's
go over that again.

60
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,033
All right.
Oh. Come on.

61
00:01:58,066 --> 00:02:00,866
As you walk in the place, move
immediately to your right...

62
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:03,951
Okay, the main thing is
to keep the line moving.

63
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:04,400
Okay, the main thing is
to keep the line moving.

64
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:05,633
So you hold out
your money,

65
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,300
speak your soup in a loud,
clear voice,

66
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:08,800
step to the left
and receive soup.

67
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,233
Right. It's very
important

68
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:11,700
not to embellish
on your order.

69
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:13,233
No extraneous
comments,

70
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,466
no questions,
no compliments.

71
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,333
Oh, boy,
I'm really scared. Elaine.

72
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:20,700
Jerry, that's enough now
about the Soup Nazi.

73
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:21,700
Whoa.

74
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,433
Wow,
look at this.

75
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:26,833
You know what this is?
This is an antique armoire.

76
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:27,900
Wow.

77
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,633
It's French. Armoire.

78
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,466
[SNOOTILY]
Armoire.

79
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:33,951
How much
is this?

80
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:34,466
How much
is this?

81
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,566
I was asking $250,

82
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,900
but you got a nice face.

83
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:37,966
Two even.

84
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,633
Huh. Heh.

85
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,366
Two hundred.

86
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,466
You know, I've always wanted
one of these things.

87
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,033
He gave you
the nice-face discount.

88
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:47,500
Yeah. All right,
you guys go ahead.

89
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,800
What about the soup?

90
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,733
I'm getting
an armoire, Jerry.

91
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:51,866
<i>Pardon.</i>

92
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:55,333
Oh, this line
is huge.

93
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:56,966
And it's like this
all the time.

94
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,733
Isn't that
that Bania guy?

95
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,200
Oh, no. It is.

96
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,400
Just be still.

97
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:03,951
Uh, too late. I think
he picked up the scent.

98
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,666
Uh, too late. I think
he picked up the scent.

99
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,533
Hey, Jerry. I didn't know
you liked soup.

100
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:10,900
Hard to believe.

101
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,866
This guy makes the best soup
in the city, Jerry.

102
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,000
The best.

103
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:16,033

they call him? "Soup Nazi."

Shh! All right,

105
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:19,166
I'm-- I'm not letting you
cut in line.

106
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,166
Why not?

107
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,233
Because if
he catches us,

108
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,466
we'll never
get soup again.

109
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,066

Excuse me. I-I-I think
you forgot my bread.

in front of me got free bread.

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,053
Well, let's
confront them.

528
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:37,420
No, no, no, no.
Let's get a cop.

529
00:18:37,453 --> 00:18:38,084
There's no cops around.
They're gonna leave.

530
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,386
There's no cops around.
They're gonna leave.

531
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,820
Come on, let's go.
Wait, Jerry.

532
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,386
Oh, wow, look.
That one is gorgeous.

533
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,986
I would just kill
for that one.

534
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,653
No, not in blue.
Blue does not go at all.

535
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:47,820
Oh, please. Do you know what
you're talking about?

536
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:49,920
I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

537
00:18:49,953 --> 00:18:51,253
Take a look at that.

538
00:18:51,286 --> 00:18:52,520
Excuse me.

539
00:18:53,686 --> 00:18:54,653
Are you talking to me?

540
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:55,653
Uh, well, uh...

541
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:58,386
I said, are you
talking to me?

542
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,786
Well, maybe
he was talking to me.

543
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,253
Was you talking to him?

544
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:04,486
Because you was obviously
talking to one of us.

545
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,420
So what is it? Who?
Who was you talking to?

546
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:12,086
We were kind of, uh...

547
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,153
talking to each other.

548
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,186
Weren't we?

549
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:24,386
I mean, yeah, I've never been
so insulted in my entire life.

550
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,586
There's something really
wrong with this man.

551
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,686
He is a Soup Nazi.

552
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,486
What?

553
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,153
What is that?
I don't know.

554
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:36,320
"Five cups chopped
porcini mushroom,

555
00:19:36,353 --> 00:19:38,084
"half a cup of olive oil,
three pounds of celery

556
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:39,220
"half a cup of olive oil,
three pounds of celery

557
00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:40,886
chopped parsley--"
Let me see this.

558
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,153
[GASPS]

559
00:19:42,186 --> 00:19:44,153
You know what this is?
This is a recipe for soup.

560
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:46,120
Look at this. There are
30 different recipes.

561
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:48,553
These are his recipes.

562
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:50,386
So?
So?

563
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,786
His secret's out.
Don't you see?

564
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,220
I could give these to
every restaurant in town.

565
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:56,786
I could have them published.

566
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,653
I could-- I could drop fliers
from a plane above the city.

567
00:19:59,686 --> 00:20:01,120
Wait a second, Elaine.

568
00:20:01,153 --> 00:20:03,320
Where do you think
you're going? What do you care?

569
00:20:03,353 --> 00:20:04,986
I don't want you
causing any trouble

570
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,120
down at that soup stand.

571
00:20:06,153 --> 00:20:07,286
I happen to love that soup.

572
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,084
Get out of my way, Jerry.

573
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:08,620
Get out of my way, Jerry.

574
00:20:08,653 --> 00:20:10,953
Elaine, let the man
make his soup.

575
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:12,420
Don't make me
hurt you, Jerry.

576
00:20:13,653 --> 00:20:15,786
Look, they have it
in blue.

577
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,620
For my baby bluey.

578
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:19,286
Are you my baby bluey?

579
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,453
Oh, yes, uh, I'm
your baby bluey.

580
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,620
SUSAN:
Oh, yes.

581
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,886
Well, well.

582
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,420
Hi, Jerry.

583
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:29,120
Hey, Susan, George.

584
00:20:29,153 --> 00:20:31,086
You know, I really
like Sheila a lot.

585
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,453
Oh, really?

586
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:34,953
Because we're kind of not
seeing each other anymore.

587
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:37,120
Oh, no, that's
too bad.

588
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,084
Yeah, well, she was
very affectionate, which I love.

589
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:39,986
Yeah, well, she was
very affectionate, which I love.

590
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,486
You know I love that.

591
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,753
But mentally, we couldn't
quite make the connection.

592
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,053
Really?
Yeah.

593
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:49,220
It's too bad because
you gotta have the affection,

594
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:50,420
which you obviously have.

595
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:52,220
I think it's great
that you're so open

596
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:54,053
with your affections
in public.

597
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,086
See, we had that.

598
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,320
Mm-hm.
You did?

599
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:58,086
Oh, yes.

600
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,486
But the mental thing...

601
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,386
But, anyway...

602
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,386
I'll see you.

603
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,586
Yeah.

604
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,986
See you.

605
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,084
Go on, leave!
Get out!

606
00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:09,486
Go on, leave!
Get out!

607
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,953
But I didn't do anything.

608
00:21:10,986 --> 00:21:12,186
Next!

609
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:17,186
Hello.

610
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:19,786
You.

611
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,253
You think
you can get soup?

612
00:21:22,286 --> 00:21:24,086
Please, you're wasting
everyone's time.

613
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,753
Well, I don't want soup.

614
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,520
I can make my own soup.

615
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,220

That is my recipe

620
00:21:40,286 --> 00:21:41,286
Yeah, that's right.

621
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,953
I got 'em all.

You're through, Soup Nazi.

626
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:51,653
Pack it up.

627
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:54,553
No more soup for you.

Something happened

W-what is the matter?

633
00:22:12,061 --> 00:22:13,794
Elaine's causing
all kinds of commotion.

634
00:22:13,827 --> 00:22:15,127
She got ahold of his recipes,

635
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:17,127
and says she's gonna drive him
out of business.

636
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:19,127
The Soup Nazi says now
that his recipes are out,

637
00:22:19,161 --> 00:22:20,594
he's not gonna make
any more soup.

638
00:22:20,627 --> 00:22:22,027
He's moving out of the country.

639
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:23,194
Moving to Argentina!

640
00:22:23,227 --> 00:22:25,361
No more soup, Jerry.
No more for any of us!

641
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:27,461
Where you going?
He's giving away what's left.
