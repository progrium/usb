inexpensive...glue?

533
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,066
Why?

534
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,900
We found traces
of a certain toxic adhesive

535
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:35,066
commonly found
in very low-priced envelopes.

536
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,519
Well, she was sending out
our wedding invitations.

537
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:38,900
Well, she was sending out
our wedding invitations.

538
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:42,400
That's probably
what did it.

539
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:45,333
We were expecting
about 200 people.

540
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:49,066
Well...

541
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,066
Thank you, doctor.

542
00:20:57,933 --> 00:21:01,733
MAN [OVER P.A.]:
<i>Blue team to ICU, please.</i> <i>Blue team, ICU.</i>

543
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:13,200
She's, uh...

544
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:14,733
gone.

545
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,100
Dead?

546
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:21,333
I'm...

547
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:25,033
so sorry, George.

548
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:27,166
Yeah. Me too.

549
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,166
Poor Lilly.

550
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,166
Susan.

551
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,333
Susan.

552
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,700
How did
it happen?

553
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,300
Apparently the, uh, glue

554
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,566
in the wedding invitations
was, uh...

555
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,666
...toxic.

556
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,566
Ah.

557
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,600
Well,
that's weird.

558
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,733
So I guess...

559
00:21:56,766 --> 00:21:58,200
you're not
getting married.

560
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,000
Yeah.

561
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:03,066
But...

562
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,066
Yeah?

563
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,666
Well...

564
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,519
now I'm engaged.

565
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,233
now I'm engaged.

566
00:22:09,266 --> 00:22:10,900
Yeah?

567
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:13,266
Well, I thought
we'd both be getting married.

568
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,566
Hey.

569
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,966
What can I tell you?

570
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,433
All right.

571
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:22,266
GEORGE:
Come on, let's, uh, get some coffee.

572
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,800
We had a pact!

[♪]

574
00:22:34,118 --> 00:22:37,585
Uh, yes, I'd like to speak
with Marisa Tomei, please.

575
00:22:39,285 --> 00:22:41,418
Marisa, hi. It's, uh--

576
00:22:41,452 --> 00:22:43,485
It's George Costanza.

577
00:22:43,518 --> 00:22:46,485
I-I'm the short, funny,
quirky bald man

578
00:22:46,518 --> 00:22:48,385
you met a little while ago. Heh.

579
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:50,985
Yeah, I was just calling
because I wanted you to know

580
00:22:51,018 --> 00:22:53,785
that, uh,
I'm not engaged anymore.

581
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:56,752
Well, uh, she died.

582
00:22:58,018 --> 00:23:00,785
Toxic glue
from the wedding invitations.

583
00:23:02,085 --> 00:23:02,393
Well, we were expecting
about 200 people.

584
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:05,252
Well, we were expecting
about 200 people.

585
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:07,718
Yeah. Anyway, um...

586
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:10,185
I've got the funeral tomorrow
but, um...

587
00:23:12,018 --> 00:23:14,885
my weekend
is pretty wide open, and...

588
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:16,218
you know, I was wondering--
