1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:02,419
How about the little scam

2
00:00:02,453 --> 00:00:05,547
the airlines have going now
with these special clubs.

3
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:08,547
Hundred and fifty dollar a year
to sit in a room, eat peanuts,

4
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:11,481
drink coffee and soda
and read magazines.

5
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:14,381
Excuse me,
isn't this the flight?

6
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:17,081
I already got four hours
of this coming to me.

7
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:19,214
What am I paying for?

8
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:21,047
How about an
I-got-all-my-luggage club?

9
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:23,081
Can I get into that?
Where is that club?

10
00:00:23,114 --> 00:00:24,547
I would like to join that club.

11
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:29,347
Airlines love to divide
us up into classes.

12
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:30,000
You know, like when you're
sitting in coach,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,214
You know, like when you're
sitting in coach,

14
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:32,581
they always have the stewardess

15
00:00:32,614 --> 00:00:34,514
close that stupid curtain,
you know?

16
00:00:34,547 --> 00:00:36,381
They always give you
that little look like,

17
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:39,947
"Maybe if you had worked
a little harder."

18
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:45,714
JERRY:
What time does your flight get in?

19
00:00:45,747 --> 00:00:48,081
Six? All right.
That gives us 6 hours.

20
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,314
Then I'll meet you
at the Diplomat's Club.

21
00:00:50,347 --> 00:00:52,514
I'll be the one
without the big red sash.

22
00:00:52,547 --> 00:00:53,714
Okay.

23
00:00:53,747 --> 00:00:54,747
See you tonight.

24
00:00:56,047 --> 00:00:57,014
Is that the supermodel?

25
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:58,081
Yep.

26
00:00:58,114 --> 00:00:59,581
She not gonna be back
for a month,

27
00:00:59,614 --> 00:01:01,014
but I have 6 hours.

28
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:02,881
I thought you had
a show in Ithaca?

29
00:01:02,914 --> 00:01:04,081
I do.
But it's 3:00.

30
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:05,081
I'm flying right back.

31
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:06,381
Then I'm gonna
meet Bridgette

32
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:08,047
at the Diplomat's club
in the airport.

33
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:09,247
Well, guess what
I'm doing?

34
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:10,714
I'm going to Mr. Pitt's,

35
00:01:10,747 --> 00:01:11,375
and I am telling him
that I am quitting.

36
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:14,247
and I am telling him
that I am quitting.

37
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:16,647
So, that's it?

38
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:18,314
You know I never even
met the guy.

39
00:01:18,347 --> 00:01:20,681
I had enough.
I am marching in.

40
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:21,681
You're marching in.

41
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:22,881
I'm marching.

42
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:24,881
Hey, hey.
Hey.

43
00:01:24,914 --> 00:01:26,681
Elaine's quitting.
Really?

44
00:01:26,714 --> 00:01:28,481
I'm marching in.

45
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:30,647
I've done the march-in.
Best feeling in the world.

46
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:31,814
How about
the march-out?

47
00:01:31,847 --> 00:01:33,314
Not as good.

48
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:35,547
That's when you realize
all the money you're losing.

49
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:36,547
Uh-huh.

50
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:38,314
Oh, boy.
Okay, that's it.

51
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:40,347
Wish me luck.
Yeah.

52
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:41,375
Get a march
going.

53
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:41,681
Get a march
going.

54
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:43,247
March it.

55
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:44,981
Jerry, I need
to borrow your camera.

56
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:45,981
Why?

57
00:01:46,014 --> 00:01:47,047
Well, I wanna put a picture

58
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:48,214
of me and my boss, Mr. Morgan,

59
00:01:48,247 --> 00:01:49,214
up in the office.

60
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:50,414
What for?

61
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:52,214
Well, he's reorganizing
the whole staff,

62
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:54,747
and I'm on thin ice
with this guy as it is.

63
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,814
Isn't putting his picture
on your desk

64
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:58,414
a little transparent?

65
00:01:58,447 --> 00:01:59,714
It better be.

66
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:08,414
Mr. Pitt, I have
something to tell you.

67
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:09,881
One second, Elaine.

68
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:10,881
Mr. Pitt--

69
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:11,375
Elaine, do you know
what I just did?

70
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,347
Elaine, do you know
what I just did?

71
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:14,647
I've just amended my will

72
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:17,047
to include you as a beneficiary.

73
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:18,981
What?

74
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,914
Well, I think of you
as part of my family.

75
00:02:20,947 --> 00:02:22,681
You've come to be
like a daughter to me,

76
00:02:22,714 --> 00:02:24,681
and I want to make sure
that you're taken care of

77
00:02:24,714 --> 00:02:26,081
after I'm gone.

78
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:27,181
Oh.

79
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:30,081
Oh, Mr. Pitt.

80
00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:31,547
[COUGHS]

81
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:33,214
I feel a cold coming on.

82
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:35,514
Could you get me a cold pill
from the medicine cabinet?

83
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:36,681
No, Mr. Pitt.
You mustn't.

84
00:02:36,714 --> 00:02:38,181
You have to check
with the pharmacy

85
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:39,914
before you mix any
of your medicine.

86
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:41,375
Yes, yes, I'll check
with the pharmacist.

87
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,247
Yes, yes, I'll check
with the pharmacist.

88
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:44,481
We don't want anything
to happen to you, Mr. Pitt.

GEORGE:
Look at that. I only got one picture left.

91
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:52,914
Uh...
You know what?

92
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:54,514
How about a shot
of me and Mr. Morgan?

93
00:02:54,547 --> 00:02:55,581
Why?

94
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:56,581
Why?

95
00:02:56,614 --> 00:02:58,581
Because we're a team.
Come on.

96
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:00,014
Would you take this
for us, dear?

97
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,447
Thank you very much.
Here we go.

98
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:05,047
Anyone ever tell you

99
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:06,881
you look a lot like
Sugar Ray Leonard?

100
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:07,881
Excuse me?

101
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:10,314
Yeah, you must hear
that all the time.

102
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:11,375
I suppose we all
look alike to you.

103
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:11,847
I suppose we all
look alike to you.

104
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:14,847
Right, Costanza?
What?

105
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:17,714
What?
No, no, no, no.

106
00:03:17,747 --> 00:03:18,714
Not a racial thing.

107
00:03:18,747 --> 00:03:20,347
There really is
a resemblance.

108
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:24,747
Don't you think
he looks like Sugar Ray?

109
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:26,014
Come on,
somebody.

110
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:27,581

111
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:29,514

A little--
Little help.

113
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:35,147
Maybe he looks a little
like Sugar Ray Leonard.

114
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,981
A little?
Come on.

115
00:03:37,014 --> 00:03:38,747
No, you still
shouldn't have said it.

116
00:03:38,781 --> 00:03:41,181
You really think that Morgan
thinks I have a racial bias?

117
00:03:41,214 --> 00:03:41,375
Maybe.

118
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,747
Maybe.

119
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:44,647
That is so unfair.

120
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,314
I would have marched on Selma
if it was in Long Island.

121
00:03:47,347 --> 00:03:49,014
So you would have marched
on Great Neck?

122
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:50,214
Absolutely.

123
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:51,581
I still might.

124
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:54,081

They would never date me.

Hey,
there you are.

00:03:56,914 --> 00:03:58,481
So, you ready?
For what?

00:03:58,514 --> 00:03:59,847

to the airport.

129
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:00,981
No, we got
a few minutes.

no luggage?

This is it.

I'm only going
for the day.

I just gotta stop
by the drugstore

and pick up
a toothbrush.

00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:09,981

that look like?

that look like?

three people I ask,

148
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:32,647
two of them will say that
it looks like Sugar Ray.

What are you doing?

00:04:36,714 --> 00:04:37,714
You're not betting.

supposed to bet.

this thing under control

do about Morgan?

00:04:53,747 --> 00:04:56,081

with some of my black friends.

00:04:56,114 --> 00:04:58,581
Yeah, except you don't really
have any black friends.

00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:23,547
I thought we could
do it again.

180
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:25,514
<i>Go away.</i>

181
00:05:25,547 --> 00:05:26,881
Remy.

182
00:05:26,914 --> 00:05:27,981
Hi.

183
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:29,414
You.

184
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:30,681
What are you doing here?

185
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:32,647
Well, I've got another
Audrey Hepburn movie.

186
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:33,881
<i>Remy, is that you?</i>

187
00:05:33,914 --> 00:05:35,514
Daddy, that man's
here again.

188
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:37,547
Remy, I want you
up here instantly.

189
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,047
You know, Remy,
I was just thinking,

190
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:41,375
the last time
we were together, you--

191
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:41,714
the last time
we were together, you--

192
00:05:50,114 --> 00:05:51,581
Oh,
that's great.

193
00:05:51,614 --> 00:05:52,881
You know what?
Leave it alone.

194
00:05:52,914 --> 00:05:54,714
Pull the car around.
We'll meet outside.

195
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:55,714
You sure?

196
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:56,981
Yeah, I'll
take care of it.

197
00:05:57,014 --> 00:05:59,281
Throw that in there,
too, would you?

198
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:04,747
Excuse me.

199
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,014
I take
heart medication.

200
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:07,981
What would you recommended
for a runny nose?

201
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:08,981
Take a antihistamine.

202
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:10,181
They're over there.

203
00:06:10,214 --> 00:06:11,181
It's all right
to take?

204
00:06:11,214 --> 00:06:11,375
Oh, yeah,
they're great.

205
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,314
Oh, yeah,
they're great.

206
00:06:12,347 --> 00:06:14,814
What about appetite
suppressants?

207
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:16,347
Uh, I just saw them.

208
00:06:16,381 --> 00:06:18,714
Oh, here.
Here you go.

209
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:19,914
Thank you,
young man.

210
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,547
Have a good day, sir.

211
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:25,547
So, this your swanky
Diplomats' Club.

212
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:27,047
I don't see Katie
anywhere.

213
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:29,747
Oh, what's this?
A fellow club member?

214
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:30,981
No, she's this woman

215
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:33,181
who's booking me
on these college tours.

216
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:35,014
She thinks I'm some kind
of big celebrity

217
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:36,081
that has to be pampered

218
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:37,647
and explained
every little thing.

219
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:39,147
Yeah, I'm gonna get
some snacks...

220
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:40,781
before my flight.

221
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:44,481
Jerry.

222
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:45,481
Oh, hi, Katie.

223
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:46,847
You found the airport all right?

224
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:48,681
Yes, I followed the planes.

225
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:51,081
I see you're
having coffee.

226
00:06:51,114 --> 00:06:53,381
Just so you know,
they also have decaf, as well,

227
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:54,814
and I talked to the hostess.

228
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,814
They'll also be
serving coffee on the plane,

229
00:06:56,847 --> 00:06:59,314
along with a selection
of cocktails and soft drinks.

230
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:00,481
Thanks.

231
00:07:00,514 --> 00:07:01,747
Thanks for telling me.

232
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:07,014
What's going on?

233
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:09,147
I'm Lenore Walker,
Mr. Pitt's estate lawyer.

234
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:10,481
I arrived to discuss
his will

235
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:11,375
and found Justin
had collapsed on the floor.

236
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,147
and found Justin
had collapsed on the floor.

237
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:14,381
Oh, my God.

238
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:15,514
Who are you?

239
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:16,981
This is the girl
I want to

240
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:18,147
put in my will.
Elaine, I--

241
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:20,681
Please rest, Mr. Pitt.

242
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:22,747
You're the assistant.

243
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:24,747
Why weren't you here
taking care of him?

244
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:26,681
Well, he gave me
the morning off.

245
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:30,247
I was doing
a little...shopping.

246
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:31,247
Uh-huh.

247
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:32,814
How did this happen?

248
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:35,081
He Took a very
dangerous combination

249
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:38,147
of prescription heart medicine
and these other pills.

250
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:40,414
Mr. Pitt, you were supposed
to talk to the pharmacist.

251
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:41,375
I spoke to somebody
who worked there.

252
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,147
I spoke to somebody
who worked there.

253
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:45,447
Oh, I'm gonna go
and call that pharmacy.

254
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:48,181
How well
do you know her?

255
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:53,714
KATIE:
Jerry, listen, just so you know,

256
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:55,547
before we take off
they're gonna tell us

257
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:56,814
what to do
in a crash.

258
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:59,181
Yes, I know.
I've flown before.

259
00:07:59,214 --> 00:08:01,981
Oh, good I just didn't
want you to freak out.

260
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,547
The chance of a crash
is very slim.

261
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:04,914
Do you have to go
to the bathroom?

262
00:08:04,947 --> 00:08:05,947
No.

263
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:11,181
Because even if you
have to go a little,

264
00:08:11,214 --> 00:08:11,375
you better go now,
because you won't get

265
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,881
you better go now,
because you won't get

266
00:08:12,914 --> 00:08:14,714
another chance until
well after take off.

267
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:20,714
Hey, how you doing?

268
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:22,381
Pretty good.

269
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:23,781
Name's Kramer.

270
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:27,481
Earl Haffler.
Nice to meet you.

271
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:29,381
I'm headed to Houston.
Where are you headed?

272
00:08:29,414 --> 00:08:31,214
Oh, I'm happy right here.

273
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:33,014
Isn't this place amazing?

274
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:35,914
Planes flying in from all
corners of the world,

275
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:38,547
and they know the minute
when they're arriving.

276
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:41,147
Oh, they don't know
a darn thing.

277
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:41,375
That's why my flight
to Houston has been delayed.

278
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,481
That's why my flight
to Houston has been delayed.

279
00:08:43,514 --> 00:08:45,381
They're all morons.

280
00:08:45,414 --> 00:08:47,547
As a matter of fact,
I'll bet you

281
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:49,681
that that flight
to Pittsburg takes off

282
00:08:49,714 --> 00:08:51,014
before my flight
to Houston.

283
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:55,181
Bet? Um, no,
I'd better not.

284
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:56,247
Friendly wager.

285
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,747
I haven't made a bet
in three years.

286
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:58,814
I don't--
Oh, come on.

287
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:00,681
Keep things interesting,
pass the time.

288
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:05,514
Okay.
How much?

289
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:06,514
How about 200.

290
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,714
You're on, cowboy.

291
00:09:12,614 --> 00:09:13,581
How you doing?

292
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:15,081
Okay.

293
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:18,214
Nice day today.

294
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:19,414
What?

295
00:09:19,447 --> 00:09:21,581
I'm George.
George Costanza.

296
00:09:21,614 --> 00:09:22,681
You live around here?

297
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:29,047
MAN [ON PA]:
<i>Now arriving at gate 12.</i>

298
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:30,981
This could be
Mexico City.

299
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:32,347
Come on, Seattle.
Let's go.

300
00:09:32,381 --> 00:09:33,347
Come on, Mexico City.

301
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:34,881
Seattle, Seattle.

<i>Flight number 42</i>
<i>from Mexico City.</i>

303
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:40,981
Yeah.

304
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:41,375
All right.

305
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,347
All right.

306
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,847
All right, come on.
Let's go again.

307
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:44,881
Let's go again.

308
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:48,514
Mr. Pitt,
do you need anything?

309
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,914
No.

310
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:52,481
You need to sit up.

311
00:09:52,514 --> 00:09:53,647
Why don't
I get you a pillow.

312
00:09:53,681 --> 00:09:55,247
Okay.

313
00:10:11,014 --> 00:10:11,375
It's a pretty
full house.

314
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,047
It's a pretty
full house.

315
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:13,414
The lighting guy's
name is Lou.

316
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,247
He's got a birthday
next week.

317
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,414
I don't care.

318
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,414
By the way, Jerry,

319
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:18,681
I don't want you
to freak out,

320
00:10:18,714 --> 00:10:20,747
but the pilot is going
to be in the audience.

321
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:22,347
Who?

322
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:23,847
Remember the plane
we took here?

323
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:25,647
The pilot is going
to be sitting out there,

324
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:27,147
watching the show.

325
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:28,147
I don't care.

326
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:29,514
Why are you
telling me this?

327
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:30,981
I just didn't
want you to freak out

328
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:31,981
when you saw him.

329
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:34,447
Why would I freak out?

330
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:36,514
Pilot.

All right, ladies and gentlemen,

332
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:41,375
a big hand
for Mr. Jerry Seinfeld.

333
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:41,614
a big hand
for Mr. Jerry Seinfeld.

334
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:46,314
Hey, all right.

335
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:47,714
Good afternoon, Ithaca.

336
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,547
Welcome.

337
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:51,914
Good to see you here.

338
00:10:51,947 --> 00:10:53,147
Boy, I tell you,
I noticed

339
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:54,681
there's a lot of those
orange cones

340
00:10:54,714 --> 00:10:56,547
you have out on the thruway
on the way--

341
00:10:58,014 --> 00:10:59,281
Up here, uh...

342
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:05,781
Um, I was-- I-- I-- Uh...

343
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:11,375
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

344
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,081
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

345
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:20,647
It didn't go
very well, did it?

346
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,214
No, it didn't.

347
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:23,247
And you know why?

348
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:24,681
Seeing that plot
in the audience

349
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:26,547
really freaked
me out.

350
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:27,681
I knew it.

351
00:11:27,714 --> 00:11:29,181
If you hadn't
mentioned anything,

352
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:30,881
I would have been fine.

353
00:11:30,914 --> 00:11:32,481
I became obsessed
with him.

354
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:34,514
Why did I invite him?
Stupid, stupid.

355
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:36,547
When he asked for tickets,
I should have said no.

356
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:37,681
I'm gonna go
chew him out.

357
00:11:37,714 --> 00:11:39,481
Oh, it doesn't
matter now.

358
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:41,147
Don't worry, Jerry.
I am on top of this.

359
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:41,375
Yeah, yeah,
you're on top of it.

360
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,514
Yeah, yeah,
you're on top of it.

361
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:43,847
And I'm on the bottom!

362
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:49,181
Well, Mr. Kramer,

363
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:51,914
looks like you're
in the hole $3200.

364
00:11:51,947 --> 00:11:54,181
Will that be
cash or check?

365
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,181
Come on,
one more bet.

366
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,281
Double or nothing, huh?

367
00:11:57,781 --> 00:11:59,081
All right.

368
00:11:59,114 --> 00:12:01,747
But I wanna see
some cash on the table.

369
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:03,081
All right.
Let me call my bank.

370
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:05,181
All right,
you stay here.

00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:14,847
Hello.

374
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:16,181
Uh, yeah, it's, uh, me.

375
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:17,247
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

376
00:12:17,281 --> 00:12:20,014
Uh... All right, listen,
I need some cash.

377
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:21,014
What for?

378
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:22,414
I just need it,
that's all.

379
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:23,647
<i>Oh, no.</i>

380
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:25,014
Don't tell me.

381
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:27,314
You're gambling again,
aren't you?

382
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,314
Oh, you weak, weak man.

383
00:12:30,347 --> 00:12:31,314
<i>Where are you?</i>

384
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:32,714
I'm at the airport.

385

But I'm down
3200 bucks,

388
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:38,681
so you gotta
get me some cash.

389
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:40,014
I don't have that kind of dough.

390
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:41,375
<i>Sure you do.</i>

391
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:41,414
<i>Sure you do.</i>

392
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:43,381
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not the bag.

393
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:45,047
Help me, man.
I'm desperate.

394
00:12:46,414 --> 00:12:47,681
All right, all right.

395
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:51,347
PILOT [ON INTERCOM]:
<i>Sorry for the delay, folks.</i>

396
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:54,081
There is a slight complication,
<i>but we're taking care of it,</i>

397
00:12:54,114 --> 00:12:56,247
<i>and we'll be on our way</i>
<i>to LaGuardia.</i>

398
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:57,447
What is
the complication?

399
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,147
Mr. Seinfeld.
Yes?

400
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,981
I'm sorry,
but the pilot has asked

401
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:04,514
that you leave this plane.

402
00:13:05,547 --> 00:13:06,747
What?

403
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:09,747
Apparently he has some
sort of problem with you.

404
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:11,375
I'm not surprised.

405
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:11,481
I'm not surprised.

406
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:13,747
I really let him
have it, Jerry.

407
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:15,514
He had no business
being in your audience

408
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:16,914
if you didn't
want him there.

409
00:13:16,947 --> 00:13:18,247
I didn't care.

410
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:20,581
Well, now the pilot
doesn't want you

411
00:13:20,614 --> 00:13:21,814
on his plane.

412
00:13:21,847 --> 00:13:23,381
He can't just
throw me off the plane.

413
00:13:23,414 --> 00:13:24,647
Yes, he can.

414
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:26,914
If he has cause to believe
that a passenger

415
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:28,014
will be a disturbance.

416
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:30,047
But I'm not
a disturbance!

417
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:32,547
Well, apparently
you are disturbing him.

418
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:34,714
But someone
is waiting for me.

419
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,147
I don't want
you to freak out.

420
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:37,581
I'm freaking out!

421
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:39,447
I am freaking out!

422
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:48,381
There's a flight
leaving at 8

423
00:13:48,414 --> 00:13:50,547
and another one
leaving at 8:30.

424
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:51,614
Which one do you want?

425
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:54,781
Which one do you
think I want?

426
00:13:56,747 --> 00:13:58,514
The 8 will get you in
a little earlier.

427
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,314
Then we'll make it
the 8.

428
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:01,414
Okay.
I'll book a hotel.

429
00:14:01,447 --> 00:14:03,314
Do you want a standard room
or a mini suite?

430
00:14:03,347 --> 00:14:04,381
Hotel?

431
00:14:04,414 --> 00:14:05,514
It's 8 in the morning.

432
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:06,514
No, no, no, no.

433
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:07,681
I have to get
home tonight.

434
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,214
Bridgette's gonna
be waiting for me

435
00:14:09,247 --> 00:14:11,214
at the Diplomat's Club.
Rent a car.

Midsize, luxury,
or sports model?

437
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:13,181
Midsize, luxury,
or sports model?

438
00:14:13,214 --> 00:14:14,614
What's your preference?

439
00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:20,014
I don't have a preference,
okay?

440
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:23,647
Just make a decision
yourself. All right?

441
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:26,214
Stop bothering me
with every minor detail.

442
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:28,547

00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:30,147

Karl, yeah, yeah.

00:14:53,014 --> 00:14:54,014
He was a nice guy.

No, not really.

Oh, don't tell me.

I'm not sure.

517
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:06,547
Is this even a road?

518
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:09,081
Oh, we lost the road
half-hour ago.

519
00:17:09,114 --> 00:17:10,914
What? Why didn't you
wake me up?

520
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:11,779
You told me not to bother you
with minor details.

521
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:13,547
You told me not to bother you

No road is a major detail.

Okay.
Now I know.

524
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:19,847
Should I keep going

525
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:20,914
Do you have
a preference?

Oh, yes, of course,
come in.
