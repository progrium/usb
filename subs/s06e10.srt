Well, uh--
I'm a comedian.

Well, I, uh--

ever notice" kinda stuff?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yep, yep.

very long either.

yourself up into something.

reminisce a little more.

Well, I'll never forget it
because that--

that I lost my virginity

I was right next to you,

00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:31,681

we were even for, like,

00:13:31,714 --> 00:13:33,648
the first five yards,
and then baboom!

433
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:34,648
You were gone.

434
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:35,118
Did I get a head start?

Oh, no.

00:13:41,214 --> 00:13:42,948
No. I'm still not
convinced,

just race again?

saying that for 20 years

to each according to his means."

What does that mean?

Well, if you got means
and ability,

464
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:40,068

combination.

open up a delicatessen?

open up a delicatessen?

Whoa. Why not?

469
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:49,202
Well, because the meats are
divided into a class system.

470
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:51,402
You got pastrami
and corned beef in one class,

and salami and bologna
in another.

That's not right.

corned beef?
