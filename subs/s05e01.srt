00:00:00,994 --> 00:00:02,994
How about that seedless
watermelon? What an invention.

00:00:03,027 --> 00:00:04,394
Scientists are working on this.

3
00:00:04,427 --> 00:00:06,261
I mean, other scientists
devote their lives

00:00:06,294 --> 00:00:08,094

AIDS, heart disease.

get rid of the seeds,

Get rid of the rind.

Yup.

Just one little problem.

confident in, uh...

what to do.

all right,

You get that tap
on the shoulder.

All right, that's enough.
You're through."

The tap is tough.

and askin' you for the ball.

Yeah.

to move on to other business.

No. No, this wasn't
moving on.

a lesson in that.

It's a very complicated area.

to figure that place out.

some things of yours here.

533
00:19:15,804 --> 00:19:16,770
I know.

534
00:19:16,804 --> 00:19:18,337
Well, I'll get them.
I'm waiting.

535
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,637
All right, then.

536
00:19:20,537 --> 00:19:21,804
You got my fins?

537
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:24,070
Yeah, I got your fins.
Do you have my poker chips?

538
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:26,604
I got your poker chips.
You got my goggles?

539
00:19:26,637 --> 00:19:28,104
They're next
to the fins.

540
00:19:28,137 --> 00:19:29,437
You got my cards?

541
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,780
They're next to
the poker chips.

542
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:30,804
They're next to
the poker chips.

543
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,637
Okay.

544
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:35,970
All right.

545
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:39,737
Guess that just about...
does it.

546
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,837
I guess.

547
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:44,270
Okay, well...

548
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:45,270
see you around.

549
00:19:45,304 --> 00:19:46,604
Yeah, see ya.

550
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:53,204
All right, let's go.
I'll give you half an hour.

551
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:57,104
What?!

552
00:19:57,137 --> 00:19:58,737
Come on.

553
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,737
Are you serious?
Look, Jerry,

554
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:00,780
we have to have sex
to save the friendship.

555
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,604
we have to have sex
to save the friendship.

556
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,270
Sex...

557
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:08,270
to <i>save</i> the friendship.

558
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,504
Well...

559
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:15,337
if we have to, we have to.

560
00:20:18,537 --> 00:20:19,670
KAREN:
Mmm...

561
00:20:19,704 --> 00:20:22,504
Oh, George.

562
00:20:22,537 --> 00:20:24,604
Ohhh.

563
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:26,937
Please, it's not necessary.

564
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,837
Mmm, what's not necessary?

565
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,780
The little extra moan
you threw in there.

566
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,937
The little extra moan
you threw in there.

567
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,504
Laying it on a bit thick,
don't you think?

568
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:36,737
What're you talking about?

569
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,937
What am I talking about?

570
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,170
Come on.

571
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,337
[LAUGHING]
You don't think I bought all that.

572
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,404
Bought what?

573
00:20:43,437 --> 00:20:45,337
No. You're very good.

574
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,004
Very good with the moanings
and the gyrations.

575
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:50,970
You really had me
goin' there for a minute.

576
00:20:51,004 --> 00:20:53,470
You think I was faking?

577
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:54,470
Come on.

578
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:57,570
With the, "Oh, George!
Oh, George!"

579
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,337
Come on.

580
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,780
Not that I don't
appreciate the effort

581
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,004
Not that I don't
appreciate the effort

582
00:21:01,037 --> 00:21:02,770
that was put into
the performance.

583
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,504
[SIGHS]

584
00:21:05,537 --> 00:21:06,604
I'd like you to leave.

585
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,437
What?

586
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,070
I said I would
like you to leave!

587
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,737
Come on, just get
your clothes on and get out.

588
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,237
But why?
Because I said so!

589
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,770
[THUMP]

590
00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:18,970
I-- I can't find
my glasses.

591
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:20,070
Well, hurry up.

592
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:21,237
Lemme look
for my glasses.

593
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,337
Get out!

594
00:21:23,604 --> 00:21:25,270
Get out!

595
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:28,004
Get out!

596
00:21:29,837 --> 00:21:30,780
[WHIMPERING]

597
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,137
[WHIMPERING]

598
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:43,337
It's all George's fault.

599
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,437
All that talk about impotence,
it got to me.

600
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,137
And that orgasm stuff.
Orgasm this and orgasm that.

601
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,004
It's a lot of pressure!

602
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:52,604
Hey, you know,
I'm a little hungry.

603
00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:54,837
You wouldn't happen to have
any of that mango left?

604
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,437
The female orgasm
is kind of like the Batcave.

605
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,404
Very few people
know where it is,

606
00:22:10,437 --> 00:22:12,670
and, uh, if you're
lucky enough to see it,

607
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:14,470
you probably don't know
how you got there,

608
00:22:14,504 --> 00:22:17,337
and you can't find
your way back after you leave.

609
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,904
[LAUGHTER & APPLAUSE]

610
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,004
There are two types
of female orgasm:

611
00:22:21,037 --> 00:22:23,337
the real and the fake.

612
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,170
And, uh, I'll tell you
right now,

613
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:27,504
as a man, we don't know.

614
00:22:27,537 --> 00:22:29,304
We do not know,
because to men,

615
00:22:29,337 --> 00:22:30,504
sex is like
a car accident,

616
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:32,004
and determining
the female orgasm

617
00:22:32,037 --> 00:22:33,304
is like being asked,

618
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:34,865
"What did you see after
the car went out of control?"

619
00:22:34,865 --> 00:22:36,237
"What did you see after
the car went out of control?"

620
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,270
"Uh, I heard a lot
of screeching sounds.

621
00:22:39,304 --> 00:22:42,470
"I-I remember I was facin'
the wrong way at one point.

622
00:22:42,504 --> 00:22:45,470
And in the end,
my body was thrown clear."
