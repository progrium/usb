00:17:19,006 --> 00:17:20,506
Listen! Listen!

537
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,706
He knew
what he was doing.

538
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:22,873
This was a signal.

539
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:24,839
A puddle of sweat's
a signal?

540
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:26,839
Yes.
It's a social thing.

541
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:29,373
What if he left a used Kleenex?
What's that, a Valentine?

542
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:32,895
Now, you tell him if he's
thinking of turning me in,

543
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:32,973
Now, you tell him if he's
thinking of turning me in,

544
00:17:33,006 --> 00:17:34,173
then I got the goods on him.

545
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:36,306
No, I won't be
a party to this.

546
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:38,706
So you'll let me
get suspended for shower urination?

Okay,
I'll talk to him,

Good. I'll talk to her
about that guy.

You know, we cannot have
people like that in here.

you want to do that?

I wouldn't do that

a violation of club policy

that many people
