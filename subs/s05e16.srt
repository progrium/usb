"What are you doing?

Al Nechy will
think twice

534
00:18:18,654 --> 00:18:21,121
before he opens his mouth
about me again.

535
00:18:21,154 --> 00:18:23,287
You know, George,
they're doing wonderful things

536
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:25,121
at mental institutions
these days.

537
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:26,821
I'd be happy to set up
a meet-and-greet.

538
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:29,621
I'm very disappointed
to hear you talk like that.

539
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:30,702
You still don't know
what makes me tick.

540
00:18:30,702 --> 00:18:31,887
You still don't know
what makes me tick.

541
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:33,221
Yes, I do.

542
00:18:33,254 --> 00:18:34,487
All right,
what are you doing?

543
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:36,221
I'm going to the hospital
to see Fulton.

544
00:18:36,254 --> 00:18:37,454
I'm not even
saying hello.

545
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:39,421
I'm going
right into material.

546
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:45,087
Oh, hey, Jer.

547
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:46,754
Oh, hey, Phil.

548
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:48,754
Ahem.

549
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:51,887
You know, I'm sorry things
didn't work out with Elaine.

550
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:53,287
I don't know
what I did wrong.

551
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:55,521
Well, you showed her
who you are. Hm.

552
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:59,621
PHIL:
Oh, look at this.

553
00:18:59,654 --> 00:19:00,702
What, she's gotta
breast feed in public?

554
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:01,787
What, she's gotta
breast feed in public?

555
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:07,754
Yeah, that's the last thing
you wanna see.

556
00:19:07,787 --> 00:19:09,787
Well...next to last.

557
00:19:10,787 --> 00:19:11,754
Look, I'll see you.

558
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:12,854
Yeah. Take it easy.

559
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,787
NURSE [OVER PA]:
<i>Dr. Callahan.</i> <i>Dr. Callahan.</i>

560
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:20,654
Hey, how you doing?

561
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:22,321
Good to be here.

562
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:28,287
BOTH:
Rock, paper, scissors. Match.

563
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:30,521
All right.
Rock beats paper.

564
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:35,087
I thought paper
covered rock.

565
00:19:35,121 --> 00:19:37,321
No. Rock flies
right through paper.

566
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:38,921
Well, what beats rock?

567
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:40,787
Nothing beats rock.

568
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:43,221
All right, come on.

569
00:19:43,254 --> 00:19:45,454
BOTH:
Rock, paper, scissors. Match.

570
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:46,954
Rock.
Rock.

571
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:48,721
BOTH:
Rock, paper, scissors. Match.

572
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,087
Rock.
Rock.

573
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:51,254
Hey, Bob.

574
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:52,754
Hey, what's
with you?

575
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:53,987
You got a problem?

576
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:55,221
You see that look
he gave me?

577
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:56,254
All right, come on.

578
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,721
Here. Ready?

579
00:19:57,754 --> 00:19:59,887
BOTH:
Rock, paper, scissors. Match.

580
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:00,702
Rock.
Rock.

581
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:01,421
Rock.
Rock.

582
00:20:01,454 --> 00:20:02,554
Hey, Tammy.

583
00:20:02,587 --> 00:20:03,954
Hello.

584
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:07,221
So, Tammy...finally,
today's our big lunch.

585
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:08,487
I don't think so.

586
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:11,121
Why not? What the hell
are you talking about?

587
00:20:11,154 --> 00:20:13,987
Look, Mickey,
everybody knows that you're heightening.

588
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:15,654
It's all over
the set.

589
00:20:15,687 --> 00:20:16,654
Wait. Wait--

590
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:18,121
Don't touch me.

591
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:20,487
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

592
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:22,387
All the progress
we've made over the years,

593
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,287
and you go and blow it
by pulling a stupid stunt like this.

594
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:27,587
Wait a second. Wait a second.
You got me all wrong.

595
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:29,454
It was all because
of the kid.

596
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:30,702
The kid
was growing.

597
00:20:30,702 --> 00:20:31,254
The kid
was growing.

598
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:34,187
He shot up
2 and a half inches in a month.

599
00:20:35,354 --> 00:20:37,254
I would have
lost my job.

600
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:41,254
Any one of you
would have done the same!

601
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:42,754
You got no right.

602
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:44,654
I'm Mickey
Abbot.

603
00:20:44,687 --> 00:20:46,621
I stood in
for Punky Brewster

604
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:48,121
when all of you
was nothing!

605
00:20:49,154 --> 00:20:51,487
It's all his fault.

606
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:53,287
It was
his idea!

607
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:54,787
Come on, Johnny.

608
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,254
Let's go get
something to eat.

609
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:03,487
Ahh!

610
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:06,621
Ahh!

611
00:21:06,654 --> 00:21:07,754
Mickey!

612
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:13,621
This guy's
belching up vitamins.

613
00:21:13,654 --> 00:21:14,787
[LAUGHS]
Stop.

614
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:16,954
And this whole
Justice League...

615
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:19,321
Batman, Green Lantern,
Wonder Woman.

616
00:21:19,354 --> 00:21:22,454
You mean to tell me Superman
can't cover everything?

617
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:23,587
[LAUGHS]
Stop.

618
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:26,621
For crying out loud,
he's Superman.

619
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:28,354
[ABRUPTLY
STOPS LAUGHING]

620
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:40,787
Fulton?

621
00:21:42,321 --> 00:21:43,454
Fulton?

622
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:53,887
George...
Mmm.

623
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:55,321
first let me
just say that

624
00:21:55,354 --> 00:21:57,254
I've never been
with a guy

625
00:21:57,287 --> 00:21:59,654
who was so committed
to commit.

626
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:01,754
I mean, it's so rare
in men these days.

627
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:05,721
And that's what makes this...
all the more difficult.

628
00:22:05,754 --> 00:22:08,387
Difficult?

629
00:22:08,421 --> 00:22:10,787
The other day, after work,
some girlfriends and I

630
00:22:10,821 --> 00:22:12,754
went to a bar for some drinks.

631
00:22:12,787 --> 00:22:15,087
And there was
this crazy mishap.

632
00:22:15,121 --> 00:22:18,621
And I wound up meeting
someone as a result.

633
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:20,054
George--

634
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:21,393
Oh, please don't.

635
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:22,787
Oh, please don't.

636
00:22:25,187 --> 00:22:28,387
Oh, I'm sorry.

637
00:22:28,421 --> 00:22:31,554
And I'm afraid the worst of it
is it's someone you know.

638
00:22:31,587 --> 00:22:33,221
Jerry Persach.

639
00:22:33,254 --> 00:22:34,921
Pachyderm?

640
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:39,487
He was carrying these
two pieces of pizza--
