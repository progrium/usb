00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:05,900
So I'm on a line
at the supermarket.

2
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:07,166
Two women in front of me.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,466
One of them,
her total was $8.00.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,400
The other, $3.00.

5
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,833
They both, of course,
choose to pay

6
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:15,166

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,166

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,500
Check.

9
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:20,166
Now...
The fact is,

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,966
if it is a woman in front of you
that's writing out the check,

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,333
you'll not be waiting long.

12
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:26,333
I have noticed that women
are very fast with checks,

13
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:29,733
you know, because they write out
so many checks.

14
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:30,000
The keys, they can never find
in their purse.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,033
The keys, they can never find
in their purse.

16
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,666
They don't know where that is.

17
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,566
But the checkbook--
They got that.

18
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,300
They never fumble
for the checkbook.

19
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,066

comes out of a holster.

There's something about a check

24

is not masculine.

Of course, they handled

Oh, that was you.

183
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,133
Imagine, spelling "mom"
with two O's.

184
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,133
That's very funny.

Well, that explains it.

Well, that explains it.

205

You know, um...

206
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,300
You could use a little work
on your manners.

207
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,033
Why, what did I do?

208
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:06,833
Well, I just don't appreciate
these little courtesy responses,

209
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:09,366
like I'm selling you
aluminum siding.

210
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,700
I was listening.

211
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,133
No, you couldn't wait
to get back

212
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,000
to your little... conversation.

213
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:18,666
No. You were talking about
the, um, the dream you had

214
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,666
where you were, um--
you had wooden teeth.

215
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,374
No! No! You had wooden teeth.

216
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:23,400
No! No! You had wooden teeth.

217
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,000
You had wooden teeth.

218
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:26,700
I didn't have wooden teeth.
You did.

219
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:29,500
All right, so I had
wooden teeth. So what?

220
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,166
So-- so nothing. Nothing.

221
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:37,333
Apparently, Plato,

222
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:40,700
who came up with the concept
of the platonic relationship,

223
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:44,666
was pretty excited about it.

224
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,066
He named it after himself.

225
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,833
He said,
"Yeah, I got this new thing--

226
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:51,033
"platonic.

227
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:52,374
"My idea, my name,
calling it after myself.

228
00:07:52,374 --> 00:07:54,433
"My idea, my name,
calling it after myself.

229
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:59,700
"What I do is,
I go out with the girls,

230
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:02,666
"I talk with them,
don't do anything,

231
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,833
"and go right home.

232
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:05,833
"What do you think?

233
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,700
I think it's going to be big."

234
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:12,900
I bet you there were
other guys in history

235
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:14,833
that tried to get relationships
named after them,

236
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:16,833
but it didn't work.

237
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:19,500
You know, I bet you there were
guys that tried to do it,

238
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:22,374
just went,
"Hi, my name's Rico. Uh...

239
00:08:22,374 --> 00:08:23,000
just went,
"Hi, my name's Rico. Uh...

240
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:26,133
"Would you like to go to bed
immediately?

241
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,866
Hey, it's
a Riconic relationship."

242
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:34,500
Hey.

243
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,133
Ah, there he is.

244
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,233
This is what I like. See?

245
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:41,433
You come home,
your parents are in your bed.

246
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,300
You know, Jerry,
we don't have to do this.

247
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,366
What are you talking about?

248
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,966
It's fine.
I love having you here.

249
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,866
Tomorrow,
we'll go to a hotel.

250
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,374
Ma, will you stop?

251
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:52,500
Ma, will you stop?

252
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,966
No, why should we take over
your apartment?

253
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,333
I don't care.
I'm sleeping next door.

254
00:08:57,366 --> 00:08:58,500
Your friend, Kramer,
doesn't mind?

255
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:00,233
No. He's making a bouillabaisse.

256
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:03,066
So, Dad, let me
ask you a question.

257
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,300
How many people work
at these big law offices?

258
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,833
Depends on the firm.

259
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:10,500
If you called up
and described someone,

260
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,500
do you think they would know
who it was?

261
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,633
What's the matter?
You need a lawyer?

262
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,033
No, I met someone at this party,

263
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:18,833
and I know where she works,
but I don't know her name.

264
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:21,000
So why don't you ask someone
who was at the party?

265
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:22,374
No, the only one I could ask
is Elaine.

266
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:23,500
No, the only one I could ask
is Elaine.

267
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:25,000
I can't ask her.
Why not?

268
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:28,500
Because it's complicated.

269
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,466
There's some tension there.

270
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,333
He used to go with her.

271
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,400
Which one is she?

272
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:34,733
From Maryland.

273
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:36,333
She brought you
the chocolates you didn't like.

274
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:40,633
Oh, yeah. Very alert.
Warm person.

275
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:41,733
Oh, yeah, she's great.

276
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:44,833
So how come
nothing materialized there?

277
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:47,000
Well, it's a tough thing
to talk about.

278
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:48,000
Uh...

279
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:51,833
I don't know.

280
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:52,374
I know what it was.

281
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:54,300
I know what it was.

282
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,500
You don't know what it was.

283
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:58,166
So what was it?

284
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,333
Well, we fight a lot
for some reason.

285
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:04,966
Oh, well.
Oh, well.

286
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,200
And there was a little problem
with the physical chemistry.

287
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,633
Well, I think
she's a very attractive girl.

288
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,300
Oh, she is.
She absolutely is.

289
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,333
I can see if there was
a weight problem...

290
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:22,374
No, it's not that.

291
00:10:22,374 --> 00:10:24,333
No, it's not that.

292
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:25,566
It wasn't all one-sided.

293
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,000
You know,
you can't be so particular.

294
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:29,233
Nobody's perfect.

295
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:30,333
I know, I know.

296
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:31,666
MORTY:
You know, Jerry,

297
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,566
it's a good thing
I wasn't so particular.

298
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,333
Idiot.

299
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:39,133
So who are you looking for,
Sophia Loren?

300
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,666
That's got nothing
to do with it.

301
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,966
How about
Loni Anderson?

302
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,633
Where do you get
Loni Anderson?

303
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,733
Why, what's wrong
with Loni Anderson?

304
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:51,000
I like Elaine
more than Loni Anderson.

305
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,374
What are you two talking about?

306
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:54,300
What are you two talking about?

307
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,000
Look, Elaine
just wasn't the one.

308
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:58,000
And this other one's
the one?

309
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,333
I don't know. Maybe.

310
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:02,500
So ask Elaine there
for the number.

311
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:03,500
I can't.

312
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:04,700
She'll get upset.

313
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:07,000
I never talk about
other women with her,

314
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,300
especially this one tonight.

315
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,500
How could you still see her
if you're not interested?

316
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:12,533
We're friends.

317
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:14,166
You don't sound like
you're friends to me.

318
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,166
If you were friends,

319
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,166
you'd ask her
for the number.

320
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,800
Do you know where
this other one works?

321
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:20,833
Oh, yeah.

322
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:22,374
So, go up
to the office.

323
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:22,833
So, go up
to the office.

324
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:24,366
Up to her office?

325
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,533
Go to the building.

326
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:27,400
She goes out to lunch,
doesn't she?

327
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:28,666
I guess.

328
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,666
So you stand
in the lobby

329
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,000
by the elevator

330
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:34,000
and wait for her
to come down for lunch.

331
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:37,000
You mean, stake out the lobby?

332
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:39,366
Morty, that's ridiculous.

333
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,566
Just ask Elaine
for the number.

334
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,233
He doesn't wanna ask
Elaine for the number.

335
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:44,966
So you got him
standing by the elevator

336
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,966
like a dope.

337
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,166
What happens
when he sees her?

338
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
He pretends
he bumped into her.

339
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:52,374
You know what?

340
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:52,500
You know what?

341
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:55,433
This is not that bad an idea.

342
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:11,774
What does
she look like?

343
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:13,474
I don't know.
It's hard to say.

344
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:16,341
What actress
does she remind you of?

345
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:18,074
Loni Anderson.

346
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:21,307
Loni Anderson?

347
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,307
What, there's something wrong
with Loni Anderson?

348
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:24,941
Hey, listen.

349
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:26,707
Thanks again for running
over here. I appreciate it.

350
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:27,300
Oh, yeah, sure.

351
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,841
Oh, yeah, sure.

352
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:29,707
I was showing a condo
on 48th street.

353
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:32,707
Besides, you think
I want to miss this?

354
00:12:34,807 --> 00:12:35,774

00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,707
Oh, sure.
I'm sorry.

537
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:12,441
How do you do?
Jerry Seinfeld.

538
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:14,174
How do you do?
Elaine Bennes.

539
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:17,841
[CHUCKLES]

540
00:19:17,874 --> 00:19:19,274
Um, do you wanna do this now

541
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:21,307
or you wanna wait
till we get in the car?

542
00:19:21,341 --> 00:19:22,507
Oh, no. Let's do it now.

543
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,807
All right.

544
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:25,441
The whole elevator business--
let me just explain.

545
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:26,441
Okay.

546
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:27,300
Jerry, are you going with us?

547
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,607
Jerry, are you going with us?

548
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:28,841
No, I'm gonna
take my car.

549
00:19:28,874 --> 00:19:30,674
That's why I brought the wagon.

550
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:32,307
Why the hell
did I bring the wagon?

551
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,107
Anyway, you know
why I didn't ask you?

552
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,774
I mean, I felt so uncomfortable,

553
00:19:37,807 --> 00:19:40,207
and you were so annoyed
in the cab.

554
00:19:40,241 --> 00:19:43,774
Well, Jerry, I never saw you
flirt with anyone before.

555
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,041
It was quite the spectacle.

556
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:46,774
Jerry, we'll
see you there.

557
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:47,774
Bye, Elaine.

558
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:49,841
Oh, bye. Good to see you.

559
00:19:49,874 --> 00:19:51,774
Oh, we didn't meet.

560
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:53,041
Oh, I'm sorry.
Elaine...

561
00:19:53,074 --> 00:19:54,707
This is my cousin
Artie "Leveen." Levine.

562
00:19:54,741 --> 00:19:55,941
CAROL: Artie!

563
00:19:55,974 --> 00:19:57,300
Artie! Come on.

564
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,207
Artie! Come on.

565
00:20:00,507 --> 00:20:01,541
Yeah, Levine.

566
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:04,041
And I'm Jerry
Cougar Mellencamp.

567
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:06,374
[LAUGHS]

568
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:07,374
[SIGHS]

569
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,441
Anyway, I admit

570
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,974
it was a fairly
ridiculous thing to do,

571
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:12,107
but I mean,

572
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:14,541
obviously, we have
a little problem here.

573
00:20:14,574 --> 00:20:16,341
Yeah, obviously.

574
00:20:16,374 --> 00:20:17,774
I mean,
if we're gonna be friends,

575
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:19,707
we gotta be able to talk
about other people.

576
00:20:19,741 --> 00:20:20,874
Couldn't agree more.

577
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:21,974
Good.

578
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:23,607
Good.

579
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:24,874
Good.

580
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,300
Great.

581
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,474
Great.

582
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:30,774
Great?

583
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:31,941
Where do you get great?

584
00:20:31,974 --> 00:20:37,607
It's great to talk about...

585
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:38,707
other people.

586
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:39,774
Guys.

587
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,874
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

588
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,874
Yeah. Well, anybody specific?

589
00:20:46,374 --> 00:20:48,274
No.

590
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:49,274
A general guy.

591
00:20:49,307 --> 00:20:53,107
Oh, really?
Elaine Marie Bennes.

592
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:54,941
What? No, it's not a big deal.

593
00:20:54,974 --> 00:20:56,774
No, that's great.
That's terrific.

594
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:57,300
No, we just met.

595
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,774
No, we just met.

596
00:20:57,807 --> 00:20:58,774
Doesn't matter.

597
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,941
What's the young man's name?

598
00:21:00,974 --> 00:21:02,507
I would like to meet him.

599
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,941
Mm...

600
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:05,507
I don't think so.

601
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,541
Well, what does he do?

602
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:08,774
Is he an artisan,
a craftsman,

603
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:11,107
a laborer of some sort?

604
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:12,107
Wall Street.

605
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:14,141
Ah, high finance.

606
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:16,374
Bulls, bears,
people from Connecticut.

607
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:21,141
And he happens to be
pretty good-looking.

608
00:21:22,974 --> 00:21:24,041
All right, sir.

609
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:27,300
And he's hilarious.

610
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,841
And he's hilarious.

611
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:31,374
Now, that's not fair.

612
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:33,107
So where did you meet this guy?

613
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:35,274
I staked out his health club.

614
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:36,274
Uh-huh.

615
00:21:36,307 --> 00:21:38,674
When you're on a stakeout,

616
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:41,807
do you find it's better
to stand up against the wall

617
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:44,307
or kind of crouch down
behind a big plant?

618
00:21:46,474 --> 00:21:49,107
You know, I think that...

619
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,107
even if you've had
a relationship with someone,

620
00:21:52,141 --> 00:21:53,441
or let's say

621
00:21:53,474 --> 00:21:55,607
especially if you've had
a relationship with someone,

622
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:57,300
and you try and become friends
afterwards,

623
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,274
and you try and become friends
afterwards,

624
00:21:58,307 --> 00:21:59,274
it's very difficult.

625
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:00,274
Isn't this?

626
00:22:00,307 --> 00:22:01,641
It's hard

627
00:22:01,674 --> 00:22:05,107
because you know each other
so well, you know?

628
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:06,541
You know
all each other's tricks.

629
00:22:06,574 --> 00:22:08,341
It's like two magicians
trying to entertain each other,

630
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:09,341
you know?

631
00:22:09,374 --> 00:22:10,674
The one goes, "Look, a rabbit."

632
00:22:10,707 --> 00:22:14,207
The other one goes, "So?"

633
00:22:14,241 --> 00:22:17,107
I believe that's your card.

634
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:19,107
Look, why don't we just
saw each other in half

635
00:22:19,141 --> 00:22:21,541
and call it a night, okay?

636
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:30,807
