Hey, that record player
is not yours.

No, look, somebody
gave it to me.

536
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,693
You're a thief.
We have proof.

537
00:20:30,726 --> 00:20:32,259
What is that?

538
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:36,959

support undergarment

How does it connect
in the back?

541
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:40,693
With a hook?

542
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:41,726
Oh, no, no, no, no.
