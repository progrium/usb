00:00:01,066 --> 00:00:02,800
I would say
the concept behind the car phone

2
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:03,866
and the phone machine,

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,866
the speaker phone,
the airline phone,

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,166
the portable phone,

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,666
the pay phone,
the cordless phone,

6
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,200
the multiline phone,
the phone pager, call waiting,

7
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:12,133
call forwarding,
call conferencing,

8
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,566
speed dialing, direct dialing,

9
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,066
and the redialing

10
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,500
is that we all have
absolutely nothing to say,

11
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:19,233
and we've got to talk to someone
about it

12
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:20,466

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,900
Cannot wait another second.

14
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:26,300
I mean, come on, you're at home,
you're on the phone.

You're in the car,
you're making calls.

You get to work--
"Any messages for me?"

You've got to give people
a chance

You've got to give people
a chance

Do you have to use the speaker?

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,233
It's safer.

24
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:46,466
Plus, it's more annoying
to the other person.

25
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,866
Oh, look at this guy.

26
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,466
What's going on?

27
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,200
There's a guy
trying to get in front of me.

28
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:52,200
He has to ask permission.

29
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:54,466
Yes, go ahead, get in, get in.

30
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,200
Did you get a "thank you" wave?

31
00:00:57,233 --> 00:00:58,566
No, nothing.

32
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,533
How could you not give
a "thank you" wave?

33
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:03,800
Hey, buddy,
where's my "thank you" wave?

34
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,410
Give me that wave!

Oh, God.

39
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:13,333
I bumped into Robin Sandusky
today.

40
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:15,333

You won't believe
what I just saw.

A car just bashed
into a parked car

45
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:23,900
and sped off right on my block.

46
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:26,300
You've got to follow that car.

48
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,333
You can't let him get away

Elaine,
the guy could be dangerous.

00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:34,733
I'm not yellow.

52
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,900
Jerry, if you don't follow him,
you're yellow.

53
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,133
Wait, he stopped. He's parking.

54
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,733
What? What?
I can't hear you. Jerry?

55
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,500
Uh, excuse me...

00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:49,233
I was... driving behind you...

00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:51,000
you know, a few blocks back,

58
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:52,500
and I-- I couldn't... help--

59
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:55,300
Maybe you didn't
realize...

60
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,700
I-- I-- I witnessed that...

00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,900
that... uh... your...

00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,233
So I wound up going out
for a decaf cappuccino

00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:19,033

69
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,666

You know, I really liked her.

We talked, we flirted.

73
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:31,733

74
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:33,400
she'd reach out

Why is that?

So you didn't turn her in.

go through with it.

Why?

94
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:10,233
Because great couples

always have a great story
about how they met.

Look,
she slammed into a parked car.

00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,366

So he gets out of the car.

I said, "Hey, buddy,
I saw you hit that car,"

136

Come on, tell me.

151
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:59,333
Well, he kind of
lost his temper,

against the car,
