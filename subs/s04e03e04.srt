1
00:00:01,666 --> 00:00:03,336
Parents like to drag kids
to these, uh,

2
00:00:03,369 --> 00:00:05,138
historical sites on vacation.

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,973
I remember going
to Colonial Williamsburg,

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,377
and you see the supposedly
authentic blacksmith there.

5
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:12,978
You know, he's got
the three-cornered hat

6
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:16,481
and the knickers
and the Def Leppard T-shirt.

7
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:18,683
My parents took me
to the Amish country,

8
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,719
which, to a kid, you know,
to see a bunch of people

9
00:00:20,752 --> 00:00:22,887
that have no cars,
no TV, no phone,

10
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,324
they go,
"So what? Neither do I."

11
00:00:25,357 --> 00:00:28,226
So it's a whole community
that's been grounded.

12
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:29,728
And that's the way
they should punish the kids

13
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:30,000
after they take them home.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,662
after they take them home.

15
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:31,730
"All right, son,
get up to your room.

16
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:32,931
"That's it. I've had it.

17
00:00:32,964 --> 00:00:36,200
"You are Amish, young man,
for the rest of this weekend.

18
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:38,402
"Did you hear me? Amish.

19
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:39,403
"And don't come down

20
00:00:39,437 --> 00:00:40,904
till you make some noodles
and raise a barn."

21
00:00:45,776 --> 00:00:47,044
So they have
a tour guide.

22
00:00:47,077 --> 00:00:48,211
He takes you around,

23
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:49,379
shows you
the battlefield,

24
00:00:49,412 --> 00:00:50,713
gives you a little bit
of the history.

25
00:00:50,748 --> 00:00:51,782
Wow. How far
is Gettysburg?

26
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:52,715
I'd like
to go there.

27
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:53,850
About three hours.

28
00:00:53,883 --> 00:00:55,052
MAN:
Tommy, you're on.

29
00:00:55,085 --> 00:00:56,786
Gotta go.
Have a good set.

30
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:02,058
What'd they do
for toilet paper

31
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:04,193
in the Civil War?

32
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:05,527
What?

33
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:08,730
I wonder what toilet paper
was like in the 1860s.

34
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:10,432
Did they--?
Did they carry it

35
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:11,875
in rolls
in their duffel bags?

36
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:12,033
in rolls
in their duffel bags?

37
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:15,271
Everything with you
comes down to toilet paper.

38
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:16,738
What?

39
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:18,907
That's always
the first question with you.

40
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,275
Why is that
always your focus?

41
00:01:20,308 --> 00:01:22,377
All right, then,
what did they do?

42
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,711
I don't know.

43
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:24,779
Maybe they gave out
big loose clumps

44
00:01:24,812 --> 00:01:26,047
to all the soldiers.

45
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:27,748
Well, I think
it would be nice

46
00:01:27,782 --> 00:01:30,251
if there was some sort of
historical record of it.

47
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:32,086
Maybe they should have
a toilet paper museum.

48
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:33,253
Would you like that?

49
00:01:33,287 --> 00:01:34,555
So we could see

50
00:01:34,589 --> 00:01:36,223
all the toilet paper
advancements

51
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,457
down through the ages:

52
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:39,059
toilet paper
during the Crusades,

53
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:40,928
the development
of the perforation,

54
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:41,875
the first six-pack.

55
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:42,262
the first six-pack.

56
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:44,598
Excuse me, Jerry?

57
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:47,434
I'm Stu Shirmack.
I'm from NBC.

58
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:48,502
Oh.

59
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:50,003
Could we speak
for a few moments?

60
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:50,970
Sure. Sure.

61
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:52,005
Hi. Jay Crespi.

62
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:52,972
Hello.

63
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:55,108
Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I.

64
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:56,509
That's right.

65
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:58,244
I'm unbelievable
at spelling last names.

66
00:01:58,277 --> 00:01:59,312
Gimme a last name.

67
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:00,479
Uh, I'm not
really--

68
00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:03,148
George...huh?

69
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:05,150
[QUIETLY]
All right. Fine.

70
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:08,620
First of all,

71
00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:11,123
that was a terrific show.

72
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:11,875
Oh, thank you very much.

73
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:12,690
Oh, thank you very much.

74
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,459
And basically I just
wanted to let you know

75
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:15,960
that we've been
discussing you

76
00:02:15,993 --> 00:02:17,495
at some
of our meetings,

77
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:20,297
and we'd be very interested
in doing something.

78
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:21,966
Really? Wow!

79
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:23,801
So if you had an idea
for, like, uh,

80
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:25,770
a TV show
for yourself...

81
00:02:25,803 --> 00:02:27,471
Well, we'd just love
to talk about it.

82
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:30,041
I'd be very interested
in something like that.

83
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:31,708
Well, here.

84
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:33,977
Why don't you
give us a call,

85
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,712
and maybe we can,
uh, develop a series?

86
00:02:35,746 --> 00:02:37,814
Okay. Great. Thanks.

87
00:02:37,848 --> 00:02:39,215
It was very nice meeting you.

88
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:40,183
Thank you.

89
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:41,217
Nice meeting you.

90
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:41,875
Nice meeting you.

91
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,286
Nice meeting you.

92
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,155
What was that
all about?

93
00:02:45,188 --> 00:02:46,822
They said they were
interested in me.

94
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:48,191
For what?

95
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:49,825
You know, a TV show.

96
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:51,326
Your own show?

97
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:53,328
Yeah, I guess so.

98
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:54,529
[SCOFFS]

99
00:02:54,564 --> 00:02:56,665
They want you
to do a TV show?

100
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:58,834
Well, they want me
to come up with an idea.

101
00:02:58,868 --> 00:03:00,302
I mean,
I don't have any ideas.

102
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:02,171
Come on.
How hard is that?

103
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:05,006
Look at all the junk
that's on TV.

104
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,075
All right, you want an idea?
Here's an idea.

105
00:03:07,108 --> 00:03:09,310
You coach a gymnastics team
in high school,

106
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:10,511
and you're married,

107
00:03:10,544 --> 00:03:11,875
and your son is not interested
in gymnastics,

108
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,147
and your son is not interested
in gymnastics,

109
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:15,416
and you're pushing him
into gymnastics.

110
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:17,385
Why should I care
if my son's into gymnastics?

111
00:03:17,418 --> 00:03:18,852
'Cause you're
the gymnastics teacher.

112
00:03:18,886 --> 00:03:20,020
It's only natural.

113
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:21,689
But gymnastics
is not for everybody.

114
00:03:21,722 --> 00:03:23,190
I know, but he's your son!

115
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:25,425
So what?

116
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,762
All right,
forget that idea.

117
00:03:28,796 --> 00:03:31,564
It's not for you.

118
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:33,866
Okay, okay, okay.
I got it.

119
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,935
You run an antique store.

120
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:37,203
Yeah? And?

121
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:38,705
And people come
into the store,

122
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:41,440
and you get involved
in their lives.

123
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:41,875
What person
who runs an antique store

124
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,575
What person
who runs an antique store

125
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:45,277
gets involved
in peoples lives?

126
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:46,845
Why not?

127
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,580
So someone comes in
to buy an old lamp,

128
00:03:48,614 --> 00:03:50,582
and suddenly I'm getting them
out of a jam?

129
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:54,620
I could see
if I was a pharmacist,

130
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:55,854
'cause a pharmacist knows

131
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,388
what's wrong with everybody
that comes in.

132
00:03:57,422 --> 00:03:59,557
I know, but antiques
are very popular right now.

133
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,892
No, they're not.
They used to be.

134
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:02,460
Oh, sure.
Like you know.

135
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,062
Oh, like you do?

136
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:09,434
And you're the manager
of the circus.

137
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:10,735
A circus?

138
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:11,875
Oh, come on!
This is a great idea.

139
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,303
Oh, come on!
This is a great idea.

140
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,639
I mean, look at
the characters.

141
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:16,373
You got all these freaks
in the show.

142
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:17,707
A woman
with a moustache.

143
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:18,943
I mean,
who wouldn't tune in

144
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:20,744
to see a woman
with a moustache?

145
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:22,546
You got the tallest man
in the world.

146
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:23,913
A guy who's just a head.

147
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:25,915
"Hee hee,
ha, fleggy."

148
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:27,416
I don't think so.

149
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:29,418
Look, Jerry, the show
isn't about the circus.

150
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:30,754
It's about
watching freaks.

151
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:32,588
I don't think the network
would go for it.

152
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:33,756
Why not?

153
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:35,724
Look, I'm not pitching
a show about freaks.

154
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:37,226
Oh, come on, Jerry!
You're wrong.

155
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,794
People, they wanna
watch freaks.

156
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:40,095
This is a "can't miss"!

157
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:41,163
Kramer.

158
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:41,875
[FLATLY]
Hello, Newman.

159
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,265
[FLATLY]
Hello, Newman.

160
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:45,267
Come on, let's go.
I got the helmet.

161
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,769
Go get
the radar detector.

162
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:48,503
Okay. Okay, all right.
I'll be back in a second.

163
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:49,837
Hey, you guys coming
to my party?

164
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,439
Yeah.
Sure. Yeah!

165
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:54,609
What's this
all about?

166
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:55,943
We're making a trade.

167
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:57,278
I'm giving him
my motorcycle helmet,

168
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,646
he's giving me
his radar detector.

169
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,181
I didn't know
you have a motorcycle.

170
00:05:00,214 --> 00:05:02,016
Well, my girlfriend had one.

171
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:03,684
You have a girlfriend?

172
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:06,353
I had a girlfriend.

173
00:05:06,387 --> 00:05:08,455
And she was pretty wild.

174
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:11,458
I don't remember you
with a girl.

175
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:11,875
Nevertheless.

176
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,460
Nevertheless.

177
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:16,863
This is a pretty bad deal
for Kramer.

178
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:18,198
You know,
a radar detector's

179
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:19,632
worth much more
than that helmet.

180
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:20,867
I think
you're cheating him.

181
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:21,867
Don't say anything.

182
00:05:21,902 --> 00:05:23,303
All right.

183
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:25,004
Hey, you know, you're
getting gypped over here.

184
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,809
Really? Ah.

185
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:31,443
Hey! We had a deal.

186
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:33,145
Are you reneging
out of the deal?

187
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:34,479
Are you reneging?
That's a renege.

188
00:05:34,513 --> 00:05:35,781
Oh, stop saying
"reneging."

189
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:37,049
Well,
you're reneging.

190
00:05:37,082 --> 00:05:38,984
I-- Okay, okay,
I'm not reneging.

191
00:05:39,018 --> 00:05:40,652
All right.
Give it to me.

192
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:41,820
All right, let go.

193
00:05:41,853 --> 00:05:41,875
No, you let go.

194
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,054
No, you let go.

195
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:44,323
Come on.
Count of three.

196
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:46,691
Give me that.
Just give me that.

197
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:47,726
...break it.

198
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,729
Here. Idiots.

199
00:05:51,762 --> 00:05:54,032
Thanks, buddy. So long.

200
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:56,634
Does that thing
work?

201
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,702
Nah.

202
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,672
JERRY:
Did I tell you

203
00:06:01,705 --> 00:06:02,840
I got a postcard
from Elaine?

204
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:04,041
Really?
Yeah.

205
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:05,042
They're in London now.

206
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:06,543
They'll be back
in a few weeks.

207
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:07,845
Pssh. I can't believe

208
00:06:07,878 --> 00:06:09,812
she got involved
with her shrink.

209
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:11,348
So, what's happening
with the TV show?

210
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:11,875
You come up with anything?

211
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:12,749
You come up with anything?

212
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:14,016
No. Nothing.

213
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,653
Why don't they have salsa
on the table?

214
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:18,988
What do you need salsa for?

215
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:22,391
Salsa is now the number one
condiment in America.

216
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,692
Do you know why?

217
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:25,727
Because people like to say
"salsa."

218
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:29,331
"Excuse me,
do you have any salsa?"

219
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:30,266
"We need more salsa."

220
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:31,933
"Where's the salsa? No salsa?"

221
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:35,036
You know, it must be
impossible for a Spanish person

222
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,572
to order seltzer
and not get salsa.

223
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:41,542
"I wanted 'selsa,' not salsa!"

224
00:06:41,576 --> 00:06:41,875
"Don't you know the difference
between selsa and salsa?"

225
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,744
"Don't you know the difference
between selsa and salsa?"

226
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,381
"You have the selsa
after the salsa."

227
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:48,883
See? This should be the show.

228
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:49,884
This is the show.

229
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:50,951
What?

230
00:06:50,985 --> 00:06:54,054
This. Just talking.

231
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:58,225
Yeah. Right.

232
00:06:58,258 --> 00:07:00,394
No, I'm really serious.
I think that's a good idea.

233
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:03,730
Just talking?
Well, what's the show about?

234
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:05,799
It's about nothing.

235
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,567
No story?

236
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:09,969
No, forget
the story.

237
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:11,570
You gotta
have a story.

238
00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:11,875
Who says you gotta
have a story?

239
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,572
Who says you gotta
have a story?

240
00:07:13,606 --> 00:07:15,208
Remember when we were waiting
for that table

241
00:07:15,241 --> 00:07:17,042
in that Chinese restaurant
that time?

242
00:07:17,075 --> 00:07:18,444
That could be a TV show.

243
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:22,915
And who's on the show?
Who are the characters?

244
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:24,582
I could be a character.

245
00:07:24,616 --> 00:07:25,751
You?

246
00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:27,585
Yeah, you base a character
on me.

247
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:28,753
So on the show,

248
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:30,888
there's a character
named George Costanza?

249
00:07:30,922 --> 00:07:32,123
Yeah.

250
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:33,425
What, there's something wrong
with that?

251
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,492
I'm a character.

252
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:35,827
People are always
saying to me,

253
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,194
"You know,
you're quite a character."

254
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,932
And who else is on the show?

255
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:41,875
Elaine could be a character.

256
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:42,566
Elaine could be a character.

257
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:43,767
Kramer.

258
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,637
Now, he's a character.
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

259
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,340
So everybody I know
is a character on the show.

260
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:50,273
Right.

261
00:07:50,307 --> 00:07:51,442
And it's about nothing.

262
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:53,109
Absolutely nothing.

263
00:07:53,143 --> 00:07:55,278
So you're saying I go into NBC

264
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:56,813
and tell them
I got this idea

265
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:58,148
for a show about nothing.

266
00:07:58,181 --> 00:07:59,950
<i>We</i> go into NBC.

267
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:01,117
We?

268
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:02,418
Since when are you a writer?

269
00:08:02,452 --> 00:08:05,154
What writer?
We're talking about a sitcom.

270
00:08:07,557 --> 00:08:09,358
You want to go with me to NBC?

271
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:11,260
Yeah, I think we really
got something here.

272
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:11,875
What do we got?
An idea.

273
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:12,594
What do we got?
An idea.

274
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:14,629
What idea?
An idea for the show.

275
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:16,765
I still don't know
what the idea is.

276
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:18,533
It's about nothing.

277
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:19,768
Right.

278
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:20,669
Everybody's
doing something.

279
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:22,203
We'll do nothing.

280
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,605
So we go
into NBC,

281
00:08:23,638 --> 00:08:26,207
we tell them we got an idea
for a show about nothing.

282
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,541
Exactly.
They say,

283
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:28,977
"What's your show about?"
I say, "Nothing."

284
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,344
There you go.

285
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:32,846
I think you may
have something here.

286
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:37,618
JERRY:
So the show would be about my real life,

287
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:40,954
and one of the characters
would be based on you.

288
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:41,875
No. I don't think so.

289
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,223
No. I don't think so.

290
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,325
What do you mean,
you don't think so?

291
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,359
I don't like it.

292
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,360
I don't understand.

293
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,895
What don't you like about it?

294
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,963
I don't like the idea of
a character based on me.

295
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,632
Why not?

296
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,234
I don't know. It just
doesn't sit well.

297
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,670
You're my neighbor. There's
got to be a character based on you.

298
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,071
That's your problem,
buddy.

299
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,873
I don't understand
what the big deal is.

300
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,874
Okay, you can do it
on one condition.

301
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:03,875
Whatever you want.

302
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:05,010
I get to play Kramer.

303
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,378
You can't play Kramer.

304
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,146
I am Kramer!

305
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:09,681
But you can't act.

306
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,875
Whoo!

307
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:12,518
Whoo!

308
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,853
Okay, fine,
we'll use Newman.

309
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:15,854
Newman?

310
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:17,422
Use me for what?

311
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:19,057
[FLATLY]
Nothing. What do you want?

312
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,360
Well, you'll never guess
what happened to me today.

313
00:09:22,393 --> 00:09:25,496
I was driving home
on the Palisades Parkway

314
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,066
when I look
in the rearview mirror,

315
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:31,535
and what did I see? The fuzz.

316
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:32,870
And it's funny,

317
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:35,505
because my new
radar detector was on,

318
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:37,707
but I didn't
hear a thing.

319
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:39,175
Isn't that strange?

320
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:41,210
Yeah, that's strange.

321
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:41,875
Because
the radar detector,

322
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,546
Because
the radar detector,

323
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:45,915
as I understand it,
detects radar!

324
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:48,217
With a series of beeps
and flashing lights!

325
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:49,385
But oddly,
for some reason,

326
00:09:49,418 --> 00:09:50,753
I didn't hear a thing,

327
00:09:50,786 --> 00:09:52,388
except for the sound
of a police siren.

328
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:55,123
Well, that's queer, huh?

329
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:56,925
I want my helmet back!

330
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,260
You give me back my helmet,

331
00:09:58,293 --> 00:09:59,728
and you're gonna pay
for that ticket.

332
00:09:59,762 --> 00:10:02,731
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You better think again, MoJumbo.

333
00:10:04,632 --> 00:10:07,135
You gave me
a defective detector. Jerry?

334
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:08,370
Buyer beware.

335
00:10:08,403 --> 00:10:10,071
Are you gonna give me back
that helmet?

336
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:11,739
No. We had a deal.

337
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:11,875
There's no guarantees in life.

338
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,040
There's no guarantees in life.

339
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:14,909
No, but there's karma, Kramer.

340
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:16,978
"Karma Kramer"?

341
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:18,780
And one more thing.

342
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:21,315
I'm not coming to your party.

343
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:28,889
[SPANISH ACCENT]
Salsa. Selsa.

344
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:30,924
Excuse me,
do you have any salsa?

345
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:33,760
No, not selsa. Salsa.

346
00:10:33,794 --> 00:10:35,495
What's the matter?

347
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:36,897
Nothing.

348
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,731
You sure?

349
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,133
You look
a little pale.

350
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,875
No. I'm fine.
I'm good.

351
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:41,901
No. I'm fine.
I'm good.

352
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:42,968
Fine. Very good.

353
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:44,437
What,
are you nervous?

354
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,337
No. Not nervous.

355
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,606
I'm good.
I'm very good.

that the humans are not smart,

would have to be

that we had to invent

What was happening,

was that we were involved

We chose not to avoid
doing these activities,

with some sort of device

our head-cracking lifestyles...

because not enough people
were wearing them,

948

with the helmet law,

because his friend was
about to commit suicide.

1063
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,093
And then
what happened?

1064
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:43,295
Well, then he became
very loud and hysterical.

1065
00:33:43,328 --> 00:33:46,231
He was flailing his arms about
as he told the story.

1066
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:48,366
And then he threw himself
on the ground.

1067
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,867
And he grabbed me
around the legs.

1068
00:33:49,901 --> 00:33:51,481
And then he begged me
to let him go.

1069
00:33:51,481 --> 00:33:52,404
And then he begged me
to let him go.

1070
00:33:52,437 --> 00:33:55,239
And when I refused,
that's when he began to scream,

1071
00:33:55,272 --> 00:33:58,475
"My friend's going to die.
My friend's going to die."

1072
00:34:01,145 --> 00:34:02,980
Look, I don't know
how you two guys feel,

1073
00:34:03,014 --> 00:34:05,081
but we'd really like
to be in business with you.

1074
00:34:05,116 --> 00:34:06,917
Well, we would like
to be in business.

1075
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,084
Love to be
in business.

1076
00:34:08,118 --> 00:34:09,319
Let's do business.
We'll do business.

1077
00:34:09,352 --> 00:34:10,621
Business.
We're in business.

1078
00:34:10,654 --> 00:34:12,122
Let's have business.
This is business.

1079
00:34:12,155 --> 00:34:14,124
Would it be possible
to get, uh, uh,

1080
00:34:14,157 --> 00:34:16,659
a copy of <i>La Cocina?</i>

1081
00:34:18,461 --> 00:34:21,297
Your off-Broadway play.

1082
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:21,481
Oh! Oh. Uh...

1083
00:34:21,481 --> 00:34:23,599
Oh! Oh. Uh...

1084
00:34:23,633 --> 00:34:26,602
Gee, you know,
it's the damndest thing.

1085
00:34:26,636 --> 00:34:29,071
I, uh...
I moved recently,

1086
00:34:29,104 --> 00:34:31,440
and my files, pfft,
disappeared.

1087
00:34:31,473 --> 00:34:34,443
Now, I-- I don't know
if they fell off the truck

1088
00:34:34,476 --> 00:34:36,278
or if there was some sort
of foul play,

1089
00:34:36,311 --> 00:34:37,746
but let me
tell you something.

1090
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:39,648
I am not through
with that moving company.

1091
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:41,583
That's my vow to you.

1092
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:44,318
Well...
I got a feeling about you two.

1093
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,287
And even more
than that...

1094
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,989
I place a great deal
of confidence

1095
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:49,457
in this lady's judgment.

1096
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,758
JERRY: Oh, that's
judgment.

1097
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:51,481
That's a pile
of judgment there.

1098
00:34:51,481 --> 00:34:51,859
That's a pile
of judgment there.

1099
00:34:51,892 --> 00:34:54,762
Yeah. Judgment
with earrings on, yes.

1100
00:34:54,795 --> 00:34:56,497
So...

1101
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,866
let's make a pilot.

1102
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:03,470
I had, uh,
gone up to Westchester.

1103
00:35:03,503 --> 00:35:06,139
I, uh, go there every Tuesday.

1104
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:08,808
I do charity work
with the blind

1105
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:10,543
in my spare time

1106
00:35:10,577 --> 00:35:12,344
for the Lighthouse.

1107
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:15,181
I was in the middle of
a game of Parcheesi

1108
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:17,349
with an old blind man,

1109
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:20,719
and I excused myself
to call my friend,

1110
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:21,481
as he was very
depressed lately

1111
00:35:21,481 --> 00:35:23,122
as he was very
depressed lately

1112
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:24,823
because he never became
a banker.

1113
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:27,626
I don't understand.

1114
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,961
You see, it had been
his lifelong dream

1115
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:31,229
to be a banker,

1116
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:32,698
and he'd, uh,
just the day before,

1117
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:34,299
he was turned down
by another bank.

1118
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,833
I believe it was

1119
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:39,370
the Manufacturers Hanover
on Lexington and 40th Street.

1120
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:41,005
That was the third bank
in two weeks

1121
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,340
to turn him down,

1122
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:43,708
so I was--
I was a little concerned.

1123
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,710
I wanted to see
how he was doing.

1124
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:48,813
Well, Your Honor,
he was barely audible,

1125
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,381
but I-- I distinctly recall
him saying...

1126
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:51,481
Yo-Yo Ma!

1127
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:52,516
Yo-Yo Ma!

1128
00:35:56,052 --> 00:35:58,922
So I sped home
to save my friend's life,

1129
00:35:58,955 --> 00:36:00,524
and I was stopped
for speeding.

1130
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:03,359
Yes, I admit I was speeding,

1131
00:36:03,392 --> 00:36:06,362
but it was to save
a man's life.

1132
00:36:06,395 --> 00:36:08,197
A close friend.

1133
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:09,198
An innocent person

1134
00:36:09,232 --> 00:36:10,999
who wanted nothing more
out of life

1135
00:36:11,033 --> 00:36:12,201
than to love,

1136
00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:13,336
to be loved,

1137
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:14,503
and to be a banker!

1138
00:36:14,537 --> 00:36:16,939
So then he didn't
kill himself?

1139
00:36:16,972 --> 00:36:18,607
No, sir, he did not,

1140
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:20,575
but only
by the grace of God.

1141
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,481
He is, uh, in
the courtroom today,

1142
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:23,045
He is, uh, in
the courtroom today,

1143
00:36:23,078 --> 00:36:25,113
sitting right over there!

1144
00:36:25,147 --> 00:36:29,751
And he can corroborate
my entire testimony.

1145
00:36:32,587 --> 00:36:34,421
I told you.
I told you!

1146
00:36:34,455 --> 00:36:37,124
[CACKLING]

1147
00:36:37,158 --> 00:36:39,226
And now all we got
to do is write it.

1148
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,929
Yes! How are we
gonna do that?

1149
00:36:42,963 --> 00:36:44,398
Hey! Congratulations.

1150
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:46,199
Oh, thanks. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

1151
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:48,401
Gee, you know, I thought
you were mad at me. No.

1152
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:50,570
Mr. Seinfeld,
you have a telephone call.

1153
00:36:50,604 --> 00:36:51,481
Phone call?

1154
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:51,805
Phone call?

1155
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:53,439
Who knows I'm here?

1156
00:36:55,508 --> 00:36:56,909
Hello.

1157
00:36:56,942 --> 00:36:59,078
Mom?

1158
00:36:59,111 --> 00:37:00,913
How did you know I was here?

1159
00:37:00,946 --> 00:37:05,988
Oh, I was not rude to him!
That is baloney.

1160
00:37:07,086 --> 00:37:10,956
I couldn't talk.
I had a meeting.

1161
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,391
I don't know.

1162
00:37:12,424 --> 00:37:15,827
He went off
on some thing about pajamas.

1163
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,128
When you sent me
the bill

1164
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:18,563
for the dry-cleaning,

1165
00:37:18,597 --> 00:37:19,764
I thought the show
didn't have a chance.

1166
00:37:19,798 --> 00:37:21,481
Oh, it was only vomit.

1167
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:23,167
Oh, it was only vomit.

1168
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:24,769
Anyway, I--
I would like to,

1169
00:37:24,803 --> 00:37:26,137
uh, to pay for
the dry-cleaning.

1170
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,438
Oh, no, no.
It's okay.

1171
00:37:27,471 --> 00:37:28,772
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1172
00:37:28,806 --> 00:37:30,274
We all chipped in.
We have the money.

1173
00:37:30,308 --> 00:37:34,011
Well...
Well, it was $18.

1174
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:37,447
Okay, $18,
and, uh...

1175
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,649
There it is,
there you go.

1176
00:37:38,682 --> 00:37:40,183
All right.

1177
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:42,152
So, uh, maybe we could
get together this weekend.

1178
00:37:42,185 --> 00:37:43,520
Yeah. Call me.

1179
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:44,521
All right.
Great.

1180
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:45,588
Bye.

1181
00:37:45,622 --> 00:37:46,589
Bye. Thanks.

1182
00:37:46,623 --> 00:37:47,924
Bye.

1183
00:37:47,957 --> 00:37:51,481
I can't believe
she took the money.

1184
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:52,662
I can't believe
she took the money.

1185
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:54,530
Why?

1186
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,698
I offered to pay.
She should've said no.

1187
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,935
She did. You insisted.

1188
00:37:58,968 --> 00:38:00,102
Maybe this is what

1189
00:38:00,136 --> 00:38:01,337
the pilot
should be about:

1190
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,304
vomiting
on somebody's vest.

1191
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:03,805
Nah.

1192
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,607
How much are we gonna get
for this, 50, 60,000?

1193
00:38:05,641 --> 00:38:07,342
Oh, I-- I don't know.

1194
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:09,344
We gotta get 50. All right,
I'll tell you what.

1195
00:38:09,377 --> 00:38:10,879
We'll go
to the coffee shop.

1196
00:38:10,912 --> 00:38:12,313
You call your manager.
Maybe they made an offer.

1197
00:38:12,347 --> 00:38:13,915
Okay.
All right, let's go, let's go.

1198
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,185
Thirteen thousand?

1199
00:38:17,218 --> 00:38:18,853
Thirteen thousand.

1200
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:19,854
Apiece?

1201
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:21,021
No, for both.

1202
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:21,481
That's insulting!

1203
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:22,289
That's insulting!

1204
00:38:22,322 --> 00:38:25,325
Ted Danson makes $800,000
an episode!

1205
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,161
Oh, would you stop
with the Ted Danson?

1206
00:38:27,194 --> 00:38:28,295
Well, he does.

1207
00:38:28,328 --> 00:38:29,629
You're nuts.
I'm sorry.

1208
00:38:29,663 --> 00:38:30,897
I can't live knowing

1209
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,732
that Ted Danson makes
that much more than me.

1210
00:38:32,766 --> 00:38:33,833
Who's he?

1211
00:38:33,867 --> 00:38:35,001
He's somebody.

1212
00:38:35,034 --> 00:38:36,135
What about me?
You're nobody.

1213
00:38:36,169 --> 00:38:37,203
Why him? Why not me?

1214
00:38:37,236 --> 00:38:38,371
He's good. You're not.

1215
00:38:38,404 --> 00:38:39,472
I'm better than him.

1216
00:38:39,506 --> 00:38:41,340
You're worse.

1217
00:38:41,374 --> 00:38:43,576
Much, much worse.

1218
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:46,012
There's Davola.

1219
00:38:46,045 --> 00:38:47,246
What? Where?
Where?

1220
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,249
Outside, I just
saw him outside.

1221
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:57,189
What is it?

1222
00:38:57,222 --> 00:39:01,026
Oh, it's this patient.

1223
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:02,594
Again?

1224
00:39:02,627 --> 00:39:04,696
I'm fairly certain

1225
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:06,163
I forgot to leave him

1226
00:39:06,198 --> 00:39:08,199
an extra prescription
for his medication.

1227
00:39:08,232 --> 00:39:10,702
Well, so, he can live
without his Valium

1228
00:39:10,735 --> 00:39:12,036
for a couple of days.

1229
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:14,605
No, you don't understand.

1230
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:18,042
He could be dangerous.

1231
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,481
Go outside
and see if he's there.

1232
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:22,012
Go outside
and see if he's there.

1233
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:24,180
I can't go out there.
He knows we're friends.

1234
00:39:24,214 --> 00:39:25,449
What am I supposed to do?

1235
00:39:25,482 --> 00:39:28,551
I gotta take Kramer
to the doctor.

1236
00:39:28,584 --> 00:39:30,120
Tell the cop.

1237
00:39:30,153 --> 00:39:31,754
Good idea.

1238
00:39:35,925 --> 00:39:37,893
Excuse me, officer.

1239
00:39:37,927 --> 00:39:40,229
There's a guy outside,
and he's kind of a nut job,

1240
00:39:40,262 --> 00:39:42,031
and I think he's waiting
to beat me up.

1241
00:39:42,064 --> 00:39:43,398
If you could just
walk me outside

1242
00:39:43,432 --> 00:39:45,100
and wait till
I get into a cab...

1243
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:46,568
Yeah, all right.

1244
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:48,403
Uh, just--
Just let me get a muffin.

1245
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:50,472
Thanks.

1246
00:39:52,441 --> 00:39:53,742
Well...

1247
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:58,780
He's gonna get a muffin,
then he'll walk us outside.

1248
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,449
This is a great way
to go through life, isn't it?

1249
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,752
Hey, he's looking
at the menu now.

1250
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:07,988
What's he looking at
the menu for?

1251
00:40:08,021 --> 00:40:10,524
I thought you said
he was gonna get a muffin.

1252
00:40:17,798 --> 00:40:20,600
What are you doing?

1253
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:21,481
What?

1254
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:21,734
What?

1255
00:40:21,768 --> 00:40:23,836
What, are you
ordering food now?

1256
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,137
Yeah.

1257
00:40:25,171 --> 00:40:26,406
Yeah, I decided
to get a sandwich.

1258
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:28,007
What happened
to the muffin?

1259
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,676
I got a little hungry.

1260
00:40:29,709 --> 00:40:31,911
All of a sudden
you get hungry?

1261
00:40:31,944 --> 00:40:34,613
Yeah.
You got a problem with that?

1262
00:40:34,646 --> 00:40:35,781
No.

1263
00:40:35,814 --> 00:40:38,884
Enjoy your lunch.

1264
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,889
You know, a muffin
can be very filling.

1265
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:51,129
He's getting a sandwich now.

1266
00:40:51,162 --> 00:40:51,481
I thought he was just
gonna have a muffin.

1267
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:52,964
I thought he was just
gonna have a muffin.

1268
00:40:52,998 --> 00:40:55,266
All of a sudden,
he gets hungry.

1269
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,934
You know, a muffin
can be very filling.

1270
00:40:56,967 --> 00:40:59,003
I know!

1271
00:41:01,305 --> 00:41:03,674
Mr. Kramer.

1272
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:05,309
You heard
the testimony so far.

1273
00:41:05,342 --> 00:41:08,278
Would you please tell
the court in your own words

1274
00:41:08,312 --> 00:41:11,648
what happened on the afternoon
of September 10th?

1275
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:14,183
What do you mean,
"in my own words"?

1276
00:41:14,217 --> 00:41:15,952
Whose words are they gonna be?

1277
00:41:15,985 --> 00:41:18,354
You know what I mean.

1278
00:41:18,387 --> 00:41:20,289
I was very upset that day.

1279
00:41:20,323 --> 00:41:21,481
And why was that?

1280
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:21,657
And why was that?

1281
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,659
Would you let me say--?
Let me talk.

1282
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:24,660
All right,
all right.

1283
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:25,694
Go ahead,
go ahead.

1284
00:41:25,728 --> 00:41:26,995
All right.
Okay.

1285
00:41:28,831 --> 00:41:30,499
I was very upset
that day

1286
00:41:30,533 --> 00:41:32,234
because I could never
become a banker.

1287
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:36,739
And this failure
to become a banker...

1288
00:41:36,772 --> 00:41:38,206
it was eating at you.

1289
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,408
Eating, eating,
eating at you inside.

1290
00:41:40,442 --> 00:41:44,212
Uh, yeah.

1291
00:41:44,246 --> 00:41:46,681
It was your family
that pushed you into banking.

1292
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:49,183
It was their dream for you.
Mr. Newman.

1293
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:51,052
Your Honor, I'm only
trying to establish

1294
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:51,481
Mr. Kramer's
fragile emotional state.

1295
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:52,519
Mr. Kramer's
fragile emotional state.

1296
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:53,888
My entire case depends on it.

1297
00:41:53,921 --> 00:41:56,657
Uh...continue.

1298
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,225
As you were saying,
Mr. Kramer?

1299
00:41:58,259 --> 00:41:59,760
What was the question?

1300
00:41:59,793 --> 00:42:01,528
You're telling how your
parents pushed you into banking.

1301
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:03,163
Right.

1302
00:42:03,196 --> 00:42:05,198
Well, my father,
when I was a kid,

1303
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,701
he took me to the bank.
And he lifted me up.

1304
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,370
And he pointed
to the teller

1305
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:13,005
and he said, "Sonny boy,
take a good look at him.

1306
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:15,508
<i>That's</i> gonna
be you someday."

1307
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:20,780
But you never became a banker,
did you, Mr. Kramer?

1308
00:42:20,813 --> 00:42:21,481
Why?

1309
00:42:21,481 --> 00:42:22,081
Why?

1310
00:42:22,114 --> 00:42:23,883
Why did you fail?

1311
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,550
I don't know.

1312
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,053
It was because
you hated your father,

1313
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,054
and you would do anything
to displease him.

1314
00:42:30,088 --> 00:42:31,756
Isn't <i>that</i> true?

1315
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,792
Uh, could you
get to the speeding?

1316
00:42:33,825 --> 00:42:35,393
Yes, I intend to,
Your Honor.

1317
00:42:35,426 --> 00:42:36,394
And then,

1318
00:42:36,427 --> 00:42:38,562
on the afternoon
of September 10th,

1319
00:42:38,596 --> 00:42:40,064
you received
a phone call,

1320
00:42:40,098 --> 00:42:41,265
did you not?

1321
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:42,967
Phone call?

1322
00:42:44,268 --> 00:42:47,070
Yes, a phone call.

1323
00:42:47,104 --> 00:42:48,706
From who?

1324
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:50,908
From me.
From you?

1325
00:42:50,941 --> 00:42:51,481
Yes! From me.
From me!

1326
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:52,442
Yes! From me.
From me!

1327
00:42:52,475 --> 00:42:53,711
I called you,
remember?

1328
00:42:53,744 --> 00:42:54,812
You called me?

1329
00:42:54,845 --> 00:42:56,646
Yes, I called you,
you idiot!

1330
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:58,415
Because
you were going to...

1331
00:42:58,448 --> 00:42:59,582
You were going to...
Remember?

1332
00:42:59,616 --> 00:43:00,750
What?
You were gonna--

1333
00:43:00,783 --> 00:43:02,152
You were gonna
ack-ka-ka-ka!

1334
00:43:02,185 --> 00:43:03,786
Gonna do something!

1335
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,087
You were dai-ya deh,
wha-hey!

1336
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:06,255
To yourself!

1337
00:43:06,288 --> 00:43:07,790
You were gonna do
something to yourself!

1338
00:43:07,824 --> 00:43:09,125
Remember, the banking?!
The banking!

1339
00:43:09,158 --> 00:43:10,426
Wha--! Ha! Hoo!
Forget the banking?!

1340
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:12,294
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to call--

1341
00:43:12,328 --> 00:43:13,930
Yes, a banker!
What banker?

1342
00:43:13,963 --> 00:43:15,431
A banker! A banker!

1343
00:43:15,464 --> 00:43:17,599
Your Honor, Your Honor,
Your Honor...

1344
00:43:17,633 --> 00:43:19,067
That's enough, Mr.--

1345
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,502
Your Honor, Mr. Kramer
is obviously very distraught.

1346
00:43:20,536 --> 00:43:21,481
I'm distraught?

1347
00:43:21,481 --> 00:43:21,637
I'm distraught?

1348
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:24,439
You shut up!
Woo, woo, woo, woo!

1349
00:43:24,472 --> 00:43:25,774
[PANTING]

1350
00:43:25,807 --> 00:43:28,776
I demand a recess
so that I can take him outside

1351
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:30,278
and help him
regain his composure!

1352
00:43:30,311 --> 00:43:32,447
That'll be $75.

1353
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,349
What's the matter
with you, you jerk?

1354
00:43:34,382 --> 00:43:36,016
We had it all worked out.

1355
00:43:41,555 --> 00:43:43,190
Is he out there?
Do you see him?

1356
00:43:43,223 --> 00:43:44,925
I'm not sure.

1357
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:47,627
Well, either you see him
or you don't.

1358
00:43:48,828 --> 00:43:50,897
All right. I don't.

1359
00:43:52,732 --> 00:43:54,300
What is he doing?

1360
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:57,303
Is he getting
coffee?

1361
00:43:57,336 --> 00:44:00,806
I think
he's getting coffee.

1362
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,242
What's with this guy?

1363
00:44:06,312 --> 00:44:08,347
Did you just
order coffee?

1364
00:44:09,515 --> 00:44:10,783
Yeah.

1365
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:12,317
This is really
too much.

1366
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,451
What is your problem?

1367
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:14,719
Well, I'm sitting
over there,

1368
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:16,188
waiting for you
to finish your sandwich

1369
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:17,122
for 20 minutes.

1370
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,223
Now you're drinking
coffee.

1371
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:19,857
That's gonna be
another 10 minutes.

1372
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:21,481
Well, you're just
gonna have to wait.

1373
00:44:21,481 --> 00:44:23,495
Well, you're just
gonna have to wait.

1374
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:25,497
You never said anything
about the banking.

1375
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,898
You're off
your rocker.

1376
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:28,365
Hey, you guys.

1377
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,366
Hey.
What're you doing here?

1378
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,501
What're you doing here?

1379
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:31,535
Hey, is Davola outside?

1380
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,070
Davola?
Yeah.

1381
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:34,071
No, I didn't see him.

1382
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:35,072
Crazy Joe Davola?

1383
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,340
Jerry, yours is $11.

1384
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:37,841
Eleven dollars,
for what?

1385
00:44:37,874 --> 00:44:40,844
Muffin, sandwich and coffee.

1386
00:44:40,877 --> 00:44:43,714
Hey, NBC okayed our idea.
We're gonna make the pilot.

1387
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,348
You're gonna do
the circus-freak show, huh?

1388
00:44:45,381 --> 00:44:46,682
No.

1389
00:44:46,716 --> 00:44:48,151
A pilot!

1390
00:44:48,184 --> 00:44:49,519
So, what do you make
for something like that,

1391
00:44:49,552 --> 00:44:50,486
50, 60,000?

1392
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,481
What's the difference?

1393
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:51,854
What's the difference?

1394
00:44:51,887 --> 00:44:54,324
The money's
not important.

1395
00:44:54,357 --> 00:44:55,725
Hey, Newman,
is that your red car?

1396
00:44:55,758 --> 00:44:57,026
Yeah.

1397
00:44:57,059 --> 00:44:58,227
I think you're getting
a ticket.

1398
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,428
Go. Run. Run.
Go! Go! Go!

1399
00:44:59,461 --> 00:45:00,329
NEWMAN: Hey, what
are you doing?

1400
00:45:00,362 --> 00:45:01,363
It's after 6:00!

1401
00:45:01,396 --> 00:45:03,232
You can't give me
a ticket.

1402
00:45:03,265 --> 00:45:04,833
Hey, you're not gonna
get away with this.

1403
00:45:04,866 --> 00:45:06,935
I'll fight this!
I've got witnesses.

1404
00:45:06,968 --> 00:45:08,503
KRAMER: I saw
the whole thing.

1405
00:45:08,537 --> 00:45:09,771
I think this whole thing

1406
00:45:09,804 --> 00:45:11,272
would be a good idea
for the pilot.

1407
00:45:11,305 --> 00:45:12,941
Ah, get out of here.
The vomiting is much funnier.

1408
00:45:12,974 --> 00:45:14,943
Oh, like you know
what you're talking about.

1409
00:45:14,976 --> 00:45:16,077
No. You do.

1410
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,711
Many states in the country

1411
00:45:17,746 --> 00:45:19,547
now have traffic school
when you have an infraction.

1412
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,481
I went to traffic school.
I didn't mind it.

1413
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:22,516
I went to traffic school.
I didn't mind it.

1414
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:23,584
I kind of felt bad

1415
00:45:23,617 --> 00:45:24,752
for the traffic school
instructor.

1416
00:45:24,785 --> 00:45:26,520
This guy goes to traffic
school every day,

1417
00:45:26,554 --> 00:45:28,456
no matter how he drives.

1418
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:31,091
What is his incentive
to not speed?

1419
00:45:31,124 --> 00:45:34,361
He's going to traffic school
anyway.

1420
00:45:34,394 --> 00:45:35,762
Why not get a race car,

1421
00:45:35,795 --> 00:45:37,364
do 200 miles an hour
down the street?

1422
00:45:37,397 --> 00:45:38,698
Cop stops you.
"Where're you going?"

1423
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:39,932
"Traffic school."

1424
00:45:39,966 --> 00:45:41,768
"Go ahead.
And you better hurry.

1425
00:45:41,801 --> 00:45:44,537
You really need it."

1426
00:45:44,571 --> 00:45:45,572
Maybe the punishment
should be,

1427
00:45:45,605 --> 00:45:47,406
instead of traffic school
or traffic court,

1428
00:45:47,439 --> 00:45:49,608
just traffic.

1429
00:45:49,641 --> 00:45:51,481
They sentence you
to 100 hours of traffic.

1430
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:53,645
They sentence you
to 100 hours of traffic.

1431
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:55,914
They assign, like, five people
to drive all around you

1432
00:45:55,947 --> 00:45:58,884
at five miles an hour
wherever you go.

1433
00:45:58,917 --> 00:46:01,987
You're on your way to Vegas,
there isn't a car in sight...

1434
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,500
"Come on. Move it."
