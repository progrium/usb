1
00:00:01,433 --> 00:00:02,833
Went out to dinner
the other night.

2
00:00:02,866 --> 00:00:05,200
Check came at the end
of the meal, as it always does.

3
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:08,366
Never liked the "check
at the end of the meal" system,

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,900
because money's
a very different thing

5
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:10,900
before and after you eat.

6
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:12,533
Before you eat,
money has no value.

7
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:14,733
You don't care about money
when you're hungry.

8
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:15,966
You sit down in a restaurant

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,533
and you're like the ruler
of an empire--

10
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:18,900
More drinks!

11
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:20,533
Appetizers!

12
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:22,700
Quickly, quickly.

13
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:26,400
It will be the greatest meal
of our lives.

14
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:28,666
Then after the meal, you know,

15
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,000
you got the pants open,
you got the napkins destroyed,

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
you got the pants open,
you got the napkins destroyed,

17
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,333
cigarette butt
in the mashed potatoes.

18
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:38,166
Then the check comes
at that moment.

19
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,866
People are always upset,
you know.

20
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,500
They're mystified by the check.
They're...

21
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:47,166
"What is this?

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,666
How could this be?"

23
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,000
They start passing it
around the table.

24
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:54,333
"Does this look right to you?

25
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:55,833
"We're not hungry now.

26
00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:58,100
Why are we buying
all this food?"

27
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:04,233
Well, I think Superman

28
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:06,866
probably has
a very good sense of humor.

29
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,733
I never heard him say
anything really funny.

30
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:11,366
But it's common sense.

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,666
He's got super strength,
super speed.

32
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,866
I'm sure he's got super humor.

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,800
You'd think that, but...

34
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,000
either you're born with
a sense of humor or you're not.

35
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:21,166
It's not gonna change.

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,166
Even if you go from
the red sun of Krypton

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,666
all the way
to the yellow sun

38
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,666
of the Earth...

39
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,666
Ehh...

40
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,666
Why?

41
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,666
Why would that one area
of his mind

42
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,477
not be affected
by the yellow sun of the Earth?

43
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:33,200
not be affected
by the yellow sun of the Earth?

44
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:35,333
I don't know.
But he ain't funny.

45
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:40,000
Hi. I know, I know.
I'm sorry I'm late.

46
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,333
No problem.

47
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:43,066
Whew.

48
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,533
I dropped a grape.

49
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:45,666
Pardon?

50
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,500
I dropped a grape
in the kitchen,

51
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,133
and it disappeared.

52
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,466
I couldn't find it.

53
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,300
I was literally
on my knees for 10 minutes

54
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,100
looking for
this stupid grape.

55
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,200
I have no idea
where it went.

57
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:00,477
Were you crying? I mean,
it's just a grape.

00:02:00,477 --> 00:02:03,700
Were you crying? I mean,
it's just a grape.

59
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,200
You'll find it.

00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:07,866
No. I'm just getting over
an allergy attack.

This guy I'm going out with--
Robert.

62
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,600
Robert.
Yes. Thank you.

63
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:18,200
He has two cats,
and I'm allergic to them.

64
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:22,366
You know, I finally meet
a normal man,

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,366
and I can't even go
into his apartment, you know?

66
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,033
And of course my apartment
is The Actors' Studio,

67
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,733
so we can't go there.

68
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:30,477
It's really causing
a lot of problems, you know?

69
00:02:30,477 --> 00:02:31,866
It's really causing
a lot of problems, you know?

He won't even go away
for the weekend

71
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:34,866
because of these cats.

72
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,700
Guys with cats...
I don't know.

73
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:38,833
I've been thinking

74
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:41,066
about asking this girl
I'm seeing--

75
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,233
Vanessa?

76
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:44,733
Vanessa. Thank you.

about asking her

00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,200
to go away
for a couple days.

79
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,733
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
I'd have to advise against that.

80
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:54,033
What do you know this woman,
a month?

81
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:55,633
You're gonna be with her
for 72 hours.

82
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,533
That's a dating decathlon.

83
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:59,033
Hey, why don't you
take her

84
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:00,477
to that place in Vermont
I was telling you about?

85
00:03:00,477 --> 00:03:01,033
to that place in Vermont
I was telling you about?

that really charming place

with separate faucets
for the hot and cold.

That's exquisite.

Listen, if it's not
too much trouble,

91
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:15,133
could you pass me
that paper over there?

92
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,066
Just the business
section is good.

93
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,466
You'd better
find that grape

94
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
before it mutates

95
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,666
into another
life form.

There was once
a mutant grape

Nobody could stop it.

it had a pit of steel.

You're getting what?

107
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:41,366
A stock.

108
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,466
What stock?

109
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,833

my friend, Simons?

Now he's got some new thing,

you know, it's supposed
to be a big merger.

115

I wasn't even supposed
to say anything.

00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,133
You guys should think
about doing this too.

supposed to go?

00:03:58,233 --> 00:03:59,633
that if I wanted
to get involved,

120
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,477
that Wilkenson would tell me
the exact right minute to sell.

121
00:04:00,477 --> 00:04:02,233
that Wilkenson would tell me
the exact right minute to sell.

are you gonna invest?

All right, all right,
I'll have the chicken salad.

on the side

Then I gave him the full turn
with the eye roll...

"Well...it's ruined,"

360

the dry cleaner can respond,

We're not responsible.

on your little transaction
there,

all told?

I don't like to discuss figures.

Simons made money.
Wilkenson cleaned up.

So Wilkenson
is out of the hospital now?

545

No.

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,152
You'd be surprised.

I gave him an ultimatum.

They're very clean animals.

I've got to say,
that's pretty bad,
