00:00:01,732 --> 00:00:04,032
Buying shoes is one of
the great shopping challenges.

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:05,865
Ever seen someone put on
a new pair of shoes?

They turn into a zombie once
they start walking around.

4
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:13,632
"Yeah, these are pretty good."

5
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:18,632
Then they have that little
1-foot-high mirror there.

6
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:22,465
What is that? To see what
cats will think of my shoes?

7
00:00:22,499 --> 00:00:24,165
What is that angle?

8
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,299
Bum passed out on the curb.

00:00:25,332 --> 00:00:28,532
"Hey, what do you
think of these?

10
00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:30,000
I just got them. I've seen
them from that angle myself."

I just got them. I've seen
them from that angle myself."

GEORGE:
That guy was amazing.

13
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:41,699
He could dunk.
And he was my height.

14
00:00:41,732 --> 00:00:43,699
What was
his name again?

15
00:00:43,732 --> 00:00:44,965
Jimmy.

16
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:46,832
Jimmy. Right.

JERRY:
I don't know how you could forget.

18
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:50,932
He kept referring to himself
in the third person.

"Jimmy's under the boards.

00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:54,199
"Jimmy's in the open.

Jimmy makes the shot."

22
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:58,865
Ah, you're just mad
because we beat you.

23
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:01,099
Jerry, it's my fault.
I couldn't make a shot.

24
00:01:01,132 --> 00:01:02,699
These losses
stay with me.

25

gonna plague me.

Great game!

32

Oh, yeah. Jimmy
played pretty good.

33
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:24,165
Hey, you know,
I felt like we had a synergy out there.

34
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:26,299
You know, like we were
really helping each other.

these things.

What are they--?
They make your legs stronger?

Oh, yeah.

42
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:38,832
Jimmy couldn't jump
at all before he got these.

43
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,599
Jimmy...was like you.

44
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,665
Huh.

GEORGE:
Plyometric?

47
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:46,865
Yeah. They isolate
the muscles.

48
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,965
The muscle has
to grow or die.

49
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:52,665
Where you get them?

50
00:01:52,699 --> 00:01:53,965
Jimmy sells them.

51

You sell them?

all out right now.

give you my card.

It's got my
home number on it.

I want to buy the first pair
when the next shipment comes in.

57
00:02:07,332 --> 00:02:09,932
All right.
All right, Jimmy, good talking to you.

58
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:11,165
Jimmy will
see you around.

Oh, Tuesday.

worked out today.

Mr. Wilhelm called
a big meeting.

63
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:21,299
I'm going to be sweating
the whole time.

64
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:22,432
Why?
You took a shower.

65
00:02:22,465 --> 00:02:23,499
It wouldn't take.

66
00:02:26,832 --> 00:02:29,032
Ten minutes from now
I'll be sweating all over again.

I can feel it.
I'm a human heat pump.

68
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:32,465
Well, you ought to
take cold showers.

69
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:34,826
Cold showers?
They're for psychotics.

70

Cold showers?
They're for psychotics.

71
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:36,799
Well, I take them.

They give me a whoosh.

73
00:02:41,965 --> 00:02:43,432
All right.
I'll see you guys later.

74
00:02:43,465 --> 00:02:44,799
So, what?
Are you heading home?

75
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,099
No. Got a dental
appointment.

Oh, what?
Tim Whatley?

77
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:48,932
Yeah.
Yeah, I got a checkup Thursday.

78
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:50,165
How do you
like that.

79
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,132
You know, you really
shouldn't brush 24 hours

80
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:53,365
before seeing
the dentist.

82

I think that's eat
24 hours before surgery.

83
00:02:57,965 --> 00:03:01,632
Oh, no. You've got
to eat before surgery.

84
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:02,965
You need
your strength.

85
00:03:10,332 --> 00:03:13,665
MR. WILHELM:
I called this meeting because we have a problem.

86
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:16,032
For the last few months,
someone has been stealing

87
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:18,632
equipment
from the club.

88
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,865
Until recently,
it's been little things:

89
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:23,199
bases, batting
helmets, donuts.

90
00:03:23,232 --> 00:03:27,032
But...two nights ago,
they pulled a big one.

91
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:29,365
They took a pitching machine,
a batting cage,

92
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:33,232
the infield tarp and all of
Mr. Steinbrenner's vitamins.

93
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:38,665
Now, we have reason
to believe it's an inside job.

94
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:40,965
So if anybody here knows
anything about it,

95
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:44,899
I recommend strongly
that...you come forward.

a little late.

take a seat, I'll call you when he's ready.

530
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:52,292
Well, I think it's about
time for George's lunch.

531
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:53,525
Yes, it is.

532
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:55,525
All right. Let's see.
What do I have today?

533
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:58,392
Oh, darn it.
It's ham and cheese again.

534
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,992
And she forgot
the fancy mustard.

535
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,525
I told her I like
that fancy mustard.

536
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:03,825
You know, you could put
that fancy mustard on a shoe,

537
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:05,358
and it would taste
pretty good to me.

538
00:21:05,392 --> 00:21:07,858
She made up for it
with a cupcake though. Hey, look at this.

539
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,525
You know, I've got a new system
of eating these things, George.

540
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:11,992
I use to peel off
the chocolate.

541
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:14,725
Now, I turn it upside down.
I eat the cake first and save...

542
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:17,325
MEL TORMÉ:
Ladies and gentlemen...

543
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:19,994
I wanna dedicate this song
to a very courageous young man.

544
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:23,325

Got the new <i>Penthouse.</i>

00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,850
