just had 10s and 20s.

529
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,564
Go ahead, count it.
Yeah.

530
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:03,630
I'm sure
it's all here.

531
00:20:03,664 --> 00:20:04,864
You know, I was just admiring

532
00:20:04,897 --> 00:20:06,564
your coffee table
out there in the hall.

533
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:08,297
You like that, huh?

534
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,197
I had that custom made for me
in Santa Fe.

535
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,697
You mind if I use it
in my book?

536
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,430
What book?

537
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:16,997
Well, I'm doing
a coffee-table book on coffee tables.

538
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:18,273
About coffee tables?

539
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:19,030
About coffee tables?

540
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:20,030
Uh-huh.

541
00:20:20,064 --> 00:20:22,364
That's fantastic.

542
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:23,397
Who's your publisher?

543
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,964
Well, I'm still
shopping it around.

544
00:20:24,997 --> 00:20:25,964
Yeah?

545
00:20:25,997 --> 00:20:27,364
You see...

546
00:20:27,397 --> 00:20:30,697
this is the kind of idea
you should be coming in with.

547
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,897
What the hell do you do around
here all day, anyway?

548
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,697
Um, well, I read manuscripts--

549
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,530
God, that Indian really
completes the room.

550
00:20:39,564 --> 00:20:41,164
Don't you think?

551
00:20:42,064 --> 00:20:43,330
[SIGHS]

552
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,273
I know this coffee table.
It's George Costanza's.

553
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:49,197
I know this coffee table.
It's George Costanza's.

554
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,964
It's mine.
I'm his mother.

555
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:53,364
Oh, I haven't seen George
for a while.

556
00:20:53,397 --> 00:20:54,864
He must be working very hard.

557
00:20:54,897 --> 00:20:57,064
George doesn't work.

558
00:20:57,097 --> 00:20:59,297
He's a bum.

559
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,630
That's why he lives
at home with us.

560
00:21:01,664 --> 00:21:03,497
He does?

561
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:07,130
I don't know why we didn't
think of this before.

562
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:08,530
We just could call <i>TV Guide.</i>

563
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:09,797
I don't know.

564
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,897
Well, it's gonna make
Mr. Costanza very happy.

565
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,430
I guess.

566
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:15,564
What's the matter?

567
00:21:15,597 --> 00:21:17,097
What do you think
is the matter?

568
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,273
I've been assigned to work
on Kramer's coffee-table book.

569
00:21:18,273 --> 00:21:21,464
I've been assigned to work
on Kramer's coffee-table book.

570
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:23,464
It is a good idea,
Elaine.

571
00:21:23,497 --> 00:21:26,130
CONDUCTOR:
Next stop, Queensborough Plaza.

572
00:21:26,164 --> 00:21:27,297
Do you want a gyro?

573
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,497
I don't think so.

574
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,597
Elaine!

575
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,764
Ah, guess your boyfriend's gonna
have to catch the next train.

576
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:42,630
He's not my boyfriend.

577
00:21:42,664 --> 00:21:44,230
He's not?

578
00:21:44,264 --> 00:21:45,964
Interesting.

579
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:01,685
I was always excited as a kid

580
00:22:01,718 --> 00:22:03,351
when that new <i>TV Guide</i>
would come.

581
00:22:03,385 --> 00:22:05,385
Somehow when that front cover's
nice and flat,

582
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:08,518
it seems like there's good,
fresh TV shows in there.

583
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:11,018
Then as the week goes by,
you start to hate the TV.

584
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:12,318
All the shows stink.

585
00:22:12,351 --> 00:22:14,351
Everything's gettin'
all crumpled and ripped

586
00:22:14,385 --> 00:22:16,351
from being sat on,
thrown across the room.

587
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:19,118
<i>TV Guide</i> is always thrown,
never handed to another person.

588
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:22,285
It's the world's most thrown
reading material.

589
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:24,351
"Where's the <i>TV Guide?</i>
There it is."

590
00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:27,818
You know, in the back
of the <i>TV Guide,</i>

591
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:29,193
they have a phone number,
95 cents a minute,

592
00:22:29,193 --> 00:22:30,218
they have a phone number,
95 cents a minute,

593
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:34,785
they'll give you the answers to
the <i>TV Guide</i> crossword puzzle.

594
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:37,985
My question is, if you can't do
the <i>TV Guide</i> crossword puzzle,

595
00:22:38,018 --> 00:22:40,685
where are you comin' across
95 cents?
