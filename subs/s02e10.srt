1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,400
Men, uh...
flip around the television

2
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:06,900
more than women, I think.

3
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:09,533
Men get that remote control
in their hands...

4
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:11,533
they don't even know what
the hell they're not watching.

5
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:13,033
You know, they just keep going.

6
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,233
"Don't even know
what I'm watching."

7
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:15,800
"What are you watching?"

8
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,800
"I don't care. I gotta keep
going." "Who was that?"

9
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,233
"Isn't that your father?"
"I don't know what it was."

10
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:21,533
"I gotta keep going!"

11
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:24,533
Women don't do that. See, now,
women will stop and go,

12
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,866
"Well, let me see
what the show is

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,233
before I change the channel."

14
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:30,000
You see, but men just fly.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,200
You see, but men just fly.

16
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:35,333
Because women, you see,
women nest, and men hunt.

17
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:37,300
That's why
we watch TV differently.

18
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,066
[♪]

19
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,066
Before there was
flipping around,

20
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,466
before there was television,

21
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,733
kings and emperors and pharaohs
and such had storytellers

22
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,900
that would tell them stories.
That was their entertainment.

23
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:52,200
I always wonder, in that era,

24
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:54,166
if they would get, like,
30 storytellers together

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,166
so they could still flip around.

26
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,966
Just go, "All right,
start telling me your story.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
"What's happening? I don't want
to hear any more. Shut up.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,200
"What's happening? I don't want
to hear any more. Shut up.

29
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:02,300
"Go to the next guy.
What are you talking about?

30
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,866
"Is there a girl in that story?
No? Shut up.

31
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,666
"I don't want to hear
that either. Shut up.

32
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,333
"No, go ahead.
What are you talking about?

33
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:09,066
I don't wanna hear that.
I'm going to bed."

34
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,800
She's pregnant?

35
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,333
Mm-hmm.

36
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:19,966
Leslie is pregnant?

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, see?
There is no justice.

38
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:23,633
She's the performance
artist, right?

39
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,733
Yeah,
performance artist.

40
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:26,966
She's a real performer,
a real trooper.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,366
What's her husband's
name again?

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,966
Chip? Kip?

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,300
Skip?

44
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,400
Todd.

45
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:36,700
Todd...
Oh, yeah.

46
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:37,966
He's a Kennedy.

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,233
No, he's not.

48
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,200
Come on, he's a third
cousin or something.

49
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:41,613
By marriage.

50
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:42,800
By marriage.

51
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,566
Oh, by marriage, yeah.

52
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,966
We went to the wedding.

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,333
You should have
heard them talking

54
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:48,533
about Chappaquiddick.

55
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,033
Tried to blame the whole
thing on bad directions.

56
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:53,533
That woman was unequivocally
the worst date of my life.

57
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:56,366
Oh, pardon me
for trying to set you up

58
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,633
with a beautiful,
intelligent woman.

59
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,533
What, you don't think
I can attract

60
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:02,466
beautiful,
intelligent women?

61
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,566
Thin ice, George,
very thin ice.

62
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,233
Maybe for her new
performance piece,

63
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:09,366
she'll give birth
on stage.

64
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,300
She stopped performing.

65
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:11,613
Oh! What a huge blow
to the culture.

66
00:02:11,613 --> 00:02:15,300
Oh! What a huge blow
to the culture.

67
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,633
Can you believe
this guy?

68
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,466
He holds a grudge
like Khomeini.

69
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,800
She dragged me
down to that warehouse

70
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,700
on the waterfront in Brooklyn
to see one of her performances.

71
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,700
Oh, when she's on stage

72
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:27,366
cooking dinner
for some celebrity?

73
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,566
God...

74
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,866
She's cooking dinner for God.

75
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,033
She's yelling and screaming,
and the next thing I know,

76
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:36,333
she throws
a big can of chocolate syrup

77
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:37,533
all over my new red shirt.

78
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:38,866
It was an accident!

79
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,300
Oh, yeah, accident, right.

80
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,613
She was aiming right at me,
like she was putting out a fire.

81
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:42,866
She was aiming right at me,
like she was putting out a fire.

82
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,633
So for the rest of the show,

83
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,500
I'm sitting there
with chocolate over my shirt.

84
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,500
Flies are landing on me.

85
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,900
I'm boiling!

86
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:53,133
I'm fantasizing all the things
I'm going to say to her,

87
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,300
and later, finally,
backstage when I talk to her,

88
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,833
I'm like a little
groveling worm.

89
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:59,866
I'm--"What kind of chocolate
was that?"

90
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,866
"Do you throw
any other foods?"

91
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,533
He thought he still
had a shot.

92
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:07,700
And then, then, then!

93
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,233
She leaves
with somebody else.

94
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:11,613
Never even--
never even said goodbye.

95
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:12,533
Never even--
never even said goodbye.

96
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:15,200
Never called me back,
never apologized, nothing.

97
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:18,033
Like I was dirt.

98
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:21,333
Whatever happened
to the shirt?

99
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:22,800
I still have it.

100
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,733
The collar's okay.
I wear it under sweaters.

101
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,966
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

102
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,200
She asked me to give her
a baby shower.

103
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,466
Asked you?

104
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,900
You're not gonna
do that, are you?

105
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:37,166
Anyone else, never,
but Leslie...

106
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,033
I have a problem
saying no to her.

107
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,866
For some reason,
I seem to want her approval.

108
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,613
Let Maria Shriver
give her a baby shower.

109
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:43,866
Let Maria Shriver
give her a baby shower.

110
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,866
Ask not what I can
do for you,

111
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,233
ask what you
can do for me.

112
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:48,233
<i>Ich bin ein</i> sucker.

113
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:50,066
Oh...

114
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,866
Would you two stop
with the Kennedys?

115
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,066
Why does everybody make such
a big deal about the Kennedys?

116
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,733
I mean,
what is this fascination?

117
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:58,200
Who cares?

118
00:03:58,233 --> 00:03:59,400
It's all so boring.

119
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:01,900
Look, she doesn't deserve
a baby shower.

120
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:04,133
She deserves a baby monsoon.

121
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,366
She deserves Rosemary's baby.

122
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:11,000
I do have one
teeny little problem, though.

123
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:11,613
Never said goodbye.
Never apologized. Nothing.

124
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:15,133
Never said goodbye.
Never apologized. Nothing.

125
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,066
See...

126
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,700
[CLEARS THROAT]

127
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,900
I was gonna give
the shower in my apartment...

128
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,066
But?

129
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,500
My roommate has Lyme disease.

130
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:25,700
Lyme disease?

131
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,533
I thought she had
Epstein-Barr Syndrome.

132
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:30,366
She has this
in addition to Epstein-Barr.

133
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,666
It's like Epstein-Barr
with a twist of Lyme disease.

134
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,400
How did she get Lyme disease?

135
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:36,700
I don't know.

136
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:39,700
She did some outdoor version
of <i>Hair</i>

137
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:40,866
in Danberry, Connecticut.

138
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,613
They still do
that play?

139
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:42,033
They still do
that play?

140
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,333
It's a classic.

141
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,566
With the nudity?

142
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,500
I guess. She must've rolled over
on a tick during the love-in.

143
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,833
Never said goodbye. Hah!
"Goodbye."

144
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:58,333
Explain to me how
this baby shower thing works?

145
00:04:58,366 --> 00:04:59,700
What do you want to know?

146
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:04,066
Well, I mean, does it ever erupt
into a drunken orgy of violence?

147
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,666
Rarely.

148
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,333
There's no hazing
of the fetus,

149
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:11,613
or anything,
is there?

150
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:12,566
or anything,
is there?

151
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,566
No. Mm-mm.

152
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,866
When is this
supposed to be?

153
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,866
Saturday.

154
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,233
Saturday.

155
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:20,833
Well, I have a show
in Buffalo on Saturday.

156
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:22,200
They're not gonna
bust up my apartment,

157
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:23,233
or anything,
are they?

158
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:24,366
No, I'll take
full responsibility.

159
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,700
You won't regret it.

160
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,366
You know, because I've
seen these pregnant women,

161
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,800
and they sometimes misjudge
their fetal girth...

162
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,200
and they'll--just like
one wrong turn,

163
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,533
the whole buffet is,
like, right off the table.

164
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:38,200
Someday, before I die,
mark my words,

165
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,400
I'm gonna tell that woman
exactly what I think of her.

166
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:41,613
I'll never be able
to forgive myself

167
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:41,833
I'll never be able
to forgive myself

168
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,233
until I do.

169
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:44,400
And if you do?

170
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,200
Well, I still won't be
able to forgive myself,

171
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,066
but at least
it won't be about this.

172
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,566
What are you
doing this for?

173
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,966
Look at you!

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,566
Quiet. I'm trying
to get a picture.

175
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,000
But you don't

524
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:04,300
I'm not paying $400.

525
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,500
I don't even want the thing.

526
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:07,766
What are you gonna do?

527
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:20,400
Every woman
on the face of the earth

528
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:23,533
has complete control
of my life...

529
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:27,866
and yet I want them all.

530
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,700
Is that irony?

531
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:30,866
[SIGHS]

532
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,866
Why can't I meet a Kennedy?

533
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,466
I saw John Junior once downtown.
I was on a bus.

534
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,466
I hit the... ding.

535
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,733
It didn't stop.

536
00:20:44,766 --> 00:20:47,492
All right, I said I had
a good time and I'd call, but...

537
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:47,966
All right, I said I had
a good time and I'd call, but...

538
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,533
who takes that literally?

539
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:53,400
Hey, come on over.

540
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:55,433
<i>Doctor Zhivago's</i> on cable
in five minutes.

541
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:59,900
I'm making popcorn.

542
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:05,000
What do you do
at the end of a date,

543
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:09,466
when you know you don't want
to see this person ever again

544
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,333
for the rest of your life?

545
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:14,033
What do you say?
What do you say?

546
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:17,492
It doesn't-- No matter
what you say, it's a lie.

547
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:18,400
It doesn't-- No matter
what you say, it's a lie.

548
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:20,500
"I'll see you around."

549
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:24,033
See you around.

550
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:26,366
If you're around,
and I'm around,

551
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,033
I'll see you around that area.

552
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:34,733
You'll be around other people,
you won't be around me,

553
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:38,400
but you will be around.

554
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:40,233
"Take care now."

555
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,800
Ever say that to somebody?

556
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,700
"Take care now."

557
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:46,700
Take care...

558
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:47,492
Now.

559
00:21:47,492 --> 00:21:49,633
Now.

560
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,533
Because I'm not gonna
be taking care of you.

561
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:55,866
So you should take care now.

562
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,633
"Take care, take care."

563
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,700
What does that mean?
"Take care."

564
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:03,200
"Take off." Isn't that
what you really want to say?

565
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:05,166
"Take off now."

566
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,000
Get out of here.

567
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,266
