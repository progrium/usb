You buying my art

540
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:39,919
You buying my art

541
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,286
is what inspired me
to get better.

542
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,419
I'll never forget
what you did for me.

543
00:18:43,453 --> 00:18:45,019
Oh, well,
that's great.

544
00:18:45,053 --> 00:18:46,753
It's really
great.

545
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:48,019
You know, art's
a great investment.

546
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:49,453
Yeah, they'll look
great in your apartment.

547
00:18:49,486 --> 00:18:52,753
Yes, I look forward
to many years of...

548
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:56,753
looking at
the triangles.

549
00:18:56,786 --> 00:18:57,919
Well, I'll, uh...

550
00:18:57,953 --> 00:18:59,119
I'll wait
for you outside.

551
00:18:59,153 --> 00:19:00,886
Hey, George.
GEORGE: Yeah?

552
00:19:05,286 --> 00:19:06,253
KRAMER:
All right.

553
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:07,253
SEINFELD:
That's nice.

554
00:19:07,286 --> 00:19:08,186
Thanks, Roy.

555
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:10,919
Hey!

556
00:19:10,953 --> 00:19:13,986
There's the guy
who saved my life.

557
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,919
You know, I don't want
to totally discount

558
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:19,253
the emotional element
in your recovery,

559
00:19:19,286 --> 00:19:22,619
but I think there were
other factors at play here.

560
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:24,853
What do you mean?

561
00:19:24,886 --> 00:19:27,119
I have no medical
evidence to back me up,

562
00:19:27,153 --> 00:19:30,419
but something happened
during the operation

563
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:33,253
that staved off
that infection.

564
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:34,786
Something beyond
science.

565
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:36,753
DR. SIEGEL:
Something, perhaps...

566
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:38,818
from above.

567
00:19:38,818 --> 00:19:38,819
from above.

568
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,286
Mint?

569
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:46,186
Those can be
very refreshing.

00:19:50,786 --> 00:19:52,086
[WITH MOUTH FULL]
So, Elaine...

571
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:56,253
Where're we going for
our big dinner on Friday?

572
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:57,519
Um...

573
00:19:58,653 --> 00:20:00,186
I am so sorry, Roy,
but, actually,

574
00:20:00,219 --> 00:20:02,086
we are going
to the Poconos on Friday.

575
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,086
Right, honey?

576
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,086
I don't think so.

577
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,353
Yeah, I think that
we, uh... We are.

578
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:08,818
I believe we're not.

579
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:09,919
I believe we're not.

[SLURPING]

581
00:20:11,786 --> 00:20:13,419
Please, can we go
to the Poconos?

582
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:14,886
Well, I'll
think about it.

583
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:17,453
MYSTERY WOMAN:
Great seats.

584
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:19,186
You could see
the actors spitting.

585
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,253
Really.
Mm-hmm.

586
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,119
And, afterwards,
we went backstage,

587
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:24,286
and Olympia Dukakis
autographed my playbill.

588
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,853
Oh. What are you saying,
you got her autograph? Yeah.

589
00:20:27,886 --> 00:20:29,119
Do you have it with you?

590
00:20:29,153 --> 00:20:31,486
Yeah, it's
in my purse.

591
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,086
Uh, let me see.

592
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:36,086
You know, I really think
I'm falling for you,

593
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,419
Jerry Seinfeld.

594
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:38,818
Oh, well, I really think
I'm falling for you...

595
00:20:38,818 --> 00:20:41,619
Oh, well, I really think
I'm falling for you...

596
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:45,019
"Joseph Poglia."

597
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:48,753
I had it autographed
for my uncle.

598
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:51,586
Yeah, I know.

599
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:54,286
You don't know
my name, do you?

600
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,519
Yes, I do.

601
00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:57,853
What is it?

602
00:20:57,886 --> 00:21:01,286
It-- It rhymes
with a female body part.

603
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,453
What is it?

604
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:05,519
Mulva?

605
00:21:09,486 --> 00:21:10,919
Um...uh...

606
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:12,486
Gipple?

607
00:21:16,153 --> 00:21:17,519
Loleola?

608
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,319
Oh!

609
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:28,286
Oh!

610
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:32,053
Dolores!

611
00:21:41,286 --> 00:21:42,786
At ages zero through 10,

612
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:45,486
candy is your life.
There's nothing else.

613
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,153
Family, friends, school,

614
00:21:47,186 --> 00:21:48,186
they're only obstacles

615
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:50,919
in the way
of getting more candy.

616
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:52,853
And you have your favorite candy
that you love.

617
00:21:52,886 --> 00:21:55,253
You know, there's ones,
"I love those, I hate those.

618
00:21:55,286 --> 00:21:57,353
I <i>hate</i> those, I <i>love</i> those."

619
00:21:57,386 --> 00:21:58,753
And only a seven-year-old kid

620
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:00,019
could actually
taste the difference

621
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:03,353
between, like, a red M&M
and a light brown M&M.

622
00:22:03,386 --> 00:22:05,286
That's two
totally different things

623
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,753
when you're a seven-year-old.

624
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:09,086
"Well, you're right,
it's more of a main-course M&M.

625
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:09,673
"But the brown,
it's more of a mellower flavor.

626
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:11,419
"But the brown,
it's more of a mellower flavor.

627
00:22:11,453 --> 00:22:13,286
It's an after-dinner M&M,
really."
