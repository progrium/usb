You know, like this afternoon--
What is chicken Kiev?

178

You know, like this afternoon--
What is chicken Kiev?

179
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,300
--I really enjoyed watching
a documentary with Louise.

180
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,633
Louise. That's what's doin' it.

181
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,400
You're no longer preoccupied
with sex,

182
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:58,400
so your mind is able to focus.

183
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,000
You think?

184
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:05,833
Yeah, I mean, let's say
this is your brain, okay?

185
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:07,400
Now, from what I know
about you,

186
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:09,833
your brain consists
of two parts.

187
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:12,500
The intellect,
represented here...

188
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,797
and the part obsessed with sex.

189
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:16,866
and the part obsessed with sex.

190
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:21,533
Now, granted, you have extracted
an astonishing amount

191
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,700
from this little scrap.

192
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:28,800
But with no-sex Louise,
this previously useless lump

193
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:32,000
is now functioning for
the first time in its existence.

194
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,400
Oh, my God.

195
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:40,800
I just remembered where I left
my retainer in second grade.

196
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:41,866
I'll see you later.

197
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,797
Hey, I need some more matches.

198
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:47,733
Hey, I need some more matches.

199
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,133
What is going on in there?

200
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,466
I met some people
smoking on the street,

201
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,000
so I invited them up
to my apartment to smoke.

202
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:55,200
Why?

203
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:56,866
Well, somebody had to.

204
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,733
You know, just because
a person's a smoker,

205
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:00,500
that doesn't mean
he's not a human being.

206
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:01,800
It doesn't?

207
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,966
Jerry, these people aren't
gonna let themselves

208
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,633

of society.

209
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,633
Why not?

210
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,400
Oh, well,
you can confine them.

211
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:11,966
You can punish them. You can
cram them into the corner,

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,866
but they're not going away,
Jerry.

213
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,666
All right.

214
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,797

215
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:17,000

So when they're handing out those cadavers,

217

in which, G, gravity, of course,
remains a constant.

Yeah, but then, you know, uh,

525
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:11,349
some people were telling me
about that, uh, little flap

526
00:22:11,382 --> 00:22:13,816
out there at the, uh,
junior high school assembly.

527
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:18,882
And before that,
you were bumped by a lizard?

528
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:20,749
Uh, it was a--

529
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:22,316
Actually, it was
a monitor lizard.

530
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:24,616
Those things, deadly, dangerous.

531
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:26,982
A long time ago,
my uncle and a date

532
00:22:27,016 --> 00:22:28,749
are driving, like,
through Mexico.

533
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:29,916
They see one on the road.

534
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,737
Drags him out of the car
and chews his face off.

535
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:31,916
Drags him out of the car
and chews his face off.

536
00:22:31,949 --> 00:22:34,782
<i>Listen, we'll call you</i>
<i>if anything opens up.</i>

537
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:35,782
<i>Okay, Jimmy?</i>

538
00:22:35,816 --> 00:22:36,849
Jerry.

539
00:22:36,882 --> 00:22:37,982
Right. Jerry.

540
00:22:38,016 --> 00:22:39,449
