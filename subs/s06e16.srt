No, siree, Bob.

181
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,694
No, siree, Bob.

182
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:45,760
Sure, I mean, in a lot of ways,
he's a typical guy.

183
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:47,027
He likes his sports.

184
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,127
But he counters that side

185
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,627
with the side you see
here tonight

186
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,627
at the ballet
or the pleasure he gets

187
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,260
watching Miss Liza Minnelli
belt out a few choice numbers.

188
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:57,794
It's those two halves
of his personality

189
00:05:57,827 --> 00:05:59,194
that just come together

190
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:01,694
to make him the very special guy
that he is.

191
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,494
Excuse me.

192
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,160
Oh. Hi, honey.

193
00:06:14,027 --> 00:06:15,827
ELAINE:
It was just such a great night.

194
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,827
Oh!
And did they suspect anything?

195
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,027
Mmm.

196
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,927
No, I was a fantastic beard.

197
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,927
I held hands,
I called him "honey."

198
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,994
And we discover
yet another talent:

199
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:30,994
posing as a girlfriend
for homosexuals.

200
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:34,694
Oh, it was just
such a great night.

201
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,927
You said that already.

202
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,160
Oh, I did?

203
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:38,160
Yeah.

204
00:06:38,194 --> 00:06:39,127
Oh.

205
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:44,560
Oh, no.

206
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,894
Don't tell me.

207
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:49,260
You like him?

208
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:50,694
He's incredible!

209
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,127
Yeah, but--

210
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,260
Yeah. I-- I know.

211
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:57,260
So?

212
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:58,260
What?

213
00:06:58,294 --> 00:06:59,994
Not conversion?

214
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:03,660
You're thinking conversion?

215
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:06,594
Well, it did occur to me.

216
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,760
You think you can get him
to just change teams?

217
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:11,427
He's not gonna suddenly
switch sides.

218
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:11,583
Forget about it.

219
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,760
Forget about it.

220
00:07:12,794 --> 00:07:14,527
Why? Is it irrevocable?

221
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,027
Because when you join that team,
it's not a whim.

222
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,327
He likes his team.

223
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,327
He's set with that team.

224
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,494
But we've got a good team.

225
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,594
Yeah, we do.

226
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:27,327
We do have a good team.

227
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,894
Well, why can't he play for us?

228
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:35,360
They're only comfortable
with <i>their</i> equipment.

229
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,583
But we just got along so great.

230
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:42,294
But we just got along so great.

231
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:44,260
Of course, you did.
Everyone gets along great

232
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:45,827
when there's
no possibility of sex.

233
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,660
No, no, no.
I sensed something.

234
00:07:47,694 --> 00:07:48,994
I did sense something.

235
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:51,194
I perceived
a possibility, Jerry.

236
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,327
You realize your venturing
into uncharted waters.

237
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,794
I realize that.

238
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:02,560
Are you that desperate?

239
00:08:03,627 --> 00:08:04,527
Yes, I am.

240
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,060
JERRY:
Are you gonna bring your gun?

241
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:11,583
Yeah, I think
you should leave it at home.

242
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,594
Yeah, I think
you should leave it at home.

243
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,660
Well, I don't really
know you that well.

244
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:17,427
What if we get into a fight
or something?

245
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,260
You know, you lose your temper.

246
00:08:19,294 --> 00:08:21,027
Who knows
what you're capable of.

247
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,660
All right,
then it's settled.

248
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:25,860
First date, no weapons.

249
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:27,660
All right.
I'll see you then.

250
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:28,960
Okay, bye.

251
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:32,527
Yeah, yeah.

252
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,260
Here we go.

253
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:35,460
What are you lookin' for?

254
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:37,260
Tupperware.

255
00:08:37,294 --> 00:08:39,594
Sorry, I don't have
any Tupperware.

256
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:41,427
See, I knew
this was gonna happen.

257
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:41,583
I just made
a delicious casserole,

258
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,260
I just made
a delicious casserole,

259
00:08:43,294 --> 00:08:46,127
but now it won't keep
'cause I have no Tupperware!

260
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,927
What about a plastic bag?

261
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,594
You must be kidding.

262
00:08:49,627 --> 00:08:50,960
What is the difference?

263
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:52,294
The patented burp, Jerry.

264
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:54,360
It locks in freshness.

265
00:08:56,294 --> 00:08:57,227
Hey-oh.
Hey. Hey.

266
00:09:00,394 --> 00:09:02,127
So, I, uh...

267
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,294
I spoke to your little
friend Denise last night.

268
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:05,660
Oh, yeah.
You talked, huh?

269
00:09:05,694 --> 00:09:06,960
Yeah. For two hours.

270
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:08,260
She's nuts about you.

271
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:09,927
Yeah, well, we go
way back, you know.

272
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,583
Why didn't anything ever happen
between you two?

273
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,494
Why didn't anything ever happen
between you two?

274
00:09:12,527 --> 00:09:14,094
Who's to say it didn't?

275
00:09:14,127 --> 00:09:15,127
Chk!

276
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:19,294
So did you describe yourself
to her over the phone?

277
00:09:19,327 --> 00:09:20,994
Yes, I did.

278
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:21,994
What did you say?

279
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:23,627
What do you think I said?

280
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,994
I don't know.

281
00:09:25,027 --> 00:09:27,094
I told her the truth.

282
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:28,527
As you see it.

283
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:33,294
Yes, as I see it.

284
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:36,860
Did you tell her about
your little hat there?

285
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:39,427
What hat?

286
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,583
You know, your little
hair hat there.

287
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,060
You know, your little
hair hat there.

288
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,660
No.

289
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:46,494
Don't you think she could tell?

290
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:47,994
No, no, no.
She can't tell.

291
00:09:48,027 --> 00:09:49,027
It's a perfect match.

292
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,160
Beautiful job.

293
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:51,360
Are you kiddin'?

294
00:09:51,394 --> 00:09:54,160
I could spot that bird's nest
two blocks away.

295
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:57,094
You only think that
because you know me.

296
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:58,994
Have you noticed
people staring at your head?

297
00:09:59,027 --> 00:10:00,494
I notice people
staring at my head

298
00:10:00,527 --> 00:10:02,927
because they like what they see.

299
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,494
I think you should
either take it off

300
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:05,494
or tell her about it.

301
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:06,660
He's not gonna
take it off.

302
00:10:06,694 --> 00:10:07,827
If he was gonna
go over bald,

303
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,327
I wouldn't have
introduced them.

304
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,583
All right, look.
I guarantee she won't know.

305
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:11,960
All right, look.
I guarantee she won't know.

306
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:12,994
Yeah. That's it.

307
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:14,460
I'm gonna go down
to the precinct.

308
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:15,760
I'm gonna have lunch
with Lou.

309
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:17,260
Oh, I'll split
a cab with you.

about the other day, man.

00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,127

I'm late.

00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,527
Perfect. Okay.

321
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,960
Just go right over there
with Officer Lampart.

00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:46,327

It's great to meet you.

00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,494
Have you been waiting long?

335
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:38,627
No, no, no. I just got
here two minutes ago.

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,794
Good, good.

00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:44,027

your hat, stay awhile?

Oh, all right.
Let me ask you.

343
00:11:58,227 --> 00:11:59,460
Now, when someone is lying,

344
00:11:59,494 --> 00:12:03,360
is it true that their pants
are actually on fire?

345
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:06,327

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,962
Did Billy sleep with
Allison's best friend?

541
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:34,227
Did Billy sleep with
Allison's best friend?

542
00:19:35,627 --> 00:19:36,527
I don't know.

543
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:44,427
Did Jane's fiancé kidnap Sydney
and take her to Las Vegas?

544
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,660
And if so, did she enjoy it?

545
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,394
I don't know.

546
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,460
Did Jane sleep
with Michael again?

547
00:19:57,327 --> 00:19:58,294
Yes!

548
00:19:58,327 --> 00:19:59,860
Yes, that stupid idiot!

549
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:02,027
He left her for Kimberly!
He slept with her sister!

550
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,962
He tricked her into givin'
him half her business!

551
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:04,127
He tricked her into givin'
him half her business!

552
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,260
And then she goes ahead
and sleeps with him again!

553
00:20:06,294 --> 00:20:08,694
I mean, she's crazy! How could
she do something like that?!

554
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:10,660
I mean, that Jane!
Oh, she just makes me so mad!

555
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:18,694
He went back?

556
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:20,827
What do you mean,
he went back?

557
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,527
He went back.

558
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,594
I don't understand, you were
having a great time.

559
00:20:24,627 --> 00:20:25,594
The sex, the shopping.

560
00:20:25,627 --> 00:20:27,694
Well, here's the thing:

561
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,460
Being a woman...

562
00:20:32,494 --> 00:20:33,962
I only really have
access to the...

563
00:20:33,962 --> 00:20:37,327
I only really have
access to the...

564
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,160
equipment...

565
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:42,027
What, 30, 45 minutes a week?

566
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,094
And that's on a good week.

567
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:47,527
How can I be expected
to have the same expertise

568
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,760
as people who own
this equipment...

569
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:55,694
and have access to it
24 hours a day...

570
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:56,960
their entire lives?

571
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:58,160
You can't.

572
00:20:58,194 --> 00:21:02,494
That's why they lose
very few players.

573
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:03,962
Yeah, I guess I never
really stood a chance.

574
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,527
Yeah, I guess I never
really stood a chance.

575
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,494
Well, there's always
a place for you...

576
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:08,594
on our team.

577
00:21:08,627 --> 00:21:12,660
Yeah. Thanks.

578
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:13,994
Is <i>Melrose Place</i> on?

579
00:21:14,027 --> 00:21:15,994
Yeah, comin' on
in a few minutes.

580
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:16,960
Okay.

581
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,694
Hey. Don't worry
it hasn't started.

582
00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:28,194
Hey, you know, George,
I am really proud of you.

583
00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:31,127
I really do admire
what you've done.

584
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,027
Do you?

585
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,962
That makes me so happy.

586
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:34,960
That makes me so happy.

587
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,427
Elaine's proud of me, Jerry.

588
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,660
What is the matter?

589
00:21:40,694 --> 00:21:44,160
I got rejected by a bald woman.

590
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:45,360
What?

591
00:21:45,394 --> 00:21:47,327
A bald woman rejected me.

592
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,594
Huh?

593
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:49,960
You like that one?

594
00:21:49,994 --> 00:21:51,460
A woman with no prospects

595
00:21:51,494 --> 00:21:52,460
and no hair

596
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:55,494
told me that <i>I</i> wasn't her type.

597
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:58,360
Apparently,
baldy likes a slimmer guy!

598
00:21:58,394 --> 00:22:00,627
Well, I'll tell you
what I think.

599
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,962
I think she saw you with that
piece off and was devastated.

600
00:22:03,962 --> 00:22:04,960
I think she saw you with that
piece off and was devastated.

601
00:22:04,994 --> 00:22:06,927
You blew it, boy!

602
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,860
You really blew it!

603
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,794
And you had to ruin it for him,
didn't you?

604
00:22:13,827 --> 00:22:14,994
I didn't ruin anything.

605
00:22:15,027 --> 00:22:17,827
He looked like an idiot.
No.

606
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,494
He did. And it made him
act like a jerk.

607
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:20,694
All right. Shut up,
shut up.

608
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:21,960
<i>Melrose Place</i> is coming on.

609
00:22:21,994 --> 00:22:24,360
[THEME FROM <i>MELROSE PLACE</i>
PLAYING]

610
00:22:28,694 --> 00:22:30,260
Oh, that Michael.
I hate him.

611
00:22:30,294 --> 00:22:32,060
He's just so smug.

612
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:45,460
How you doin', Stu?

613
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:47,494
Eddie, my man.

614
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:50,794
You again?

615
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,827
Boy, you're a slippery one.

616
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,160
You better straighten up
and fly right, buddy boy.

617
00:22:55,194 --> 00:22:56,427
What do you got?

618
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,027
I got an eye witness to
that jewelry store break-in.

619
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,994
Come here.

620
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:04,327
Do you recognize anybody
in this line-up?

621
00:23:06,894 --> 00:23:08,527
That's the guy, officer!

622
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,734
The guy there in the middle,
the tall guy with the high hair.

623
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:12,027
The guy there in the middle,
the tall guy with the high hair.

624
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,860
I'd recognize him anywhere.

625
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,094
Hey, you.

626
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,360
<i>You with the high hair.</i>

627
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,994
<i>Step forward.</i>

628
00:23:19,527 --> 00:23:21,627
Me?
