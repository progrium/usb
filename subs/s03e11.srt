00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:41,714
Doesn't my credit card
cover me or something?

particular one.

Not that
particular one.

520
00:17:43,514 --> 00:17:44,714
I got a hundred cards.

521
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:47,581
Here, here. Pick a card.
Take any card you want.

522
00:17:47,614 --> 00:17:49,381

Really, sir, if you had read
the rental agreement--

00:17:52,414 --> 00:17:53,981
Did you see the size
of that document?

525
00:17:54,014 --> 00:17:55,547
It's like the Declaration
of Independence.

526
00:17:55,581 --> 00:17:57,547
Who's gonna read that?

527
00:17:57,581 --> 00:17:58,914
Mr. Seinfeld,
as it stands right now,

528
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:00,747
you are not covered
for that damage

529
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:04,914

that can be done about that.

00:18:15,647 --> 00:18:20,081
Ahhh. It's good,
isn't it?

532
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:23,047
Yankee bean.

533
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:25,647
Why "Yankee" bean, huh?

534
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:29,081
Don't they have beans
in the South?

535
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:32,414
I mean, if you order Yankee bean
in the South, are they offended?

536
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:33,481
Huh?

I'm not really sure

that I'm ready to make

I'm just not really sure
that we have enough in common.

I mean, for example:

562
00:19:51,514 --> 00:19:54,914
I like running in the park,

00:19:54,947 --> 00:19:56,614

And, um, well,

566
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:07,581
I'm gonna be brutally
honest with you now.

00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:39,047
could you actually die

575
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:41,970
An overdose of odor.
Good question.

576

An overdose of odor.
Good question.

00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:07,914

doing here?

then Woody yells, "Action."

[IN UNISON]
"These pretzels are

00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:34,147
Then I took
a swig of beer

601
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:36,147
and I slammed the glass
down on the bar,

602
00:21:36,181 --> 00:21:37,214
and it shattered.

00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:39,481

00:21:39,514 --> 00:21:41,970
Well, one of the pieces
must've hit Woody,

must've hit Woody,

"I'm bleeding," and he runs off.

to me, and she says,

The best part of a relationship
is when you're sick.

is when you're
in a relationship.

for better or for worse."

All I need is the sickness.
That is the most important one.

620
00:22:30,304 --> 00:22:34,604
"Do you take this man
in sickness?"

621
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:36,304
That's the only time
I need somebody there.

622

have a ball.

00:22:39,604 --> 00:22:42,404

you better be there.
