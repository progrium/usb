I knew I had hit my high note,

00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,100
I thanked the crowd,

she's just a liar, right?

Hello, boys.
Hey,

200
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,300
so did you give that radio
the old switcheroo?

201
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,300
I did.

off of his bumper,

00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:09,266
a Jesus fish.

Jerry,
you have any fish sticks?

No.

No.

209
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:17,766
So you're disappointed
he's a spiritual person?

210
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,500
Well, yeah. I got him because
he seemed so one-dimensional.

211

Isn't that
a little premature?

218

I thought so.

I'm against

So self-absorbed
and egotistical.

complicated shoes.

535
00:20:06,063 --> 00:20:08,529
You know, Jerry,
there's this thing

536
00:20:08,563 --> 00:20:09,996
that I haven't
told you about.

537
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:11,163
See...

538
00:20:11,196 --> 00:20:14,963
there was this tractor
and...

539
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:15,985
[SIGHS]

540
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:16,129
[SIGHS]

541
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:17,429
Oh, boy, this is...

542
00:20:17,463 --> 00:20:18,763
This is really difficult.

543
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:22,029
Sophie, it's me.

544
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:25,829
I know about
the tractor story.

545
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:27,763
And I'm fine with it.

546
00:20:27,796 --> 00:20:28,763
How could you know?

547
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:31,896
Shh. Shh. Shh.

548
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:34,829
It's not important.

549
00:20:34,863 --> 00:20:36,129
What's important

550
00:20:36,163 --> 00:20:38,229
is I'm not gonna let
a little thing like that

551
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:40,263
ruin what could be

552
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:43,629
a very long-term
and meaningful relationship.

553
00:20:43,663 --> 00:20:44,996
KRAMER:
I didn't say that. No.

554
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:45,985
You gave me gonorrhea.
You didn't even tell me.

555
00:20:45,985 --> 00:20:47,963
You gave me gonorrhea.
You didn't even tell me.

556
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,229
Well, I'm sorry.

557
00:20:49,263 --> 00:20:50,629
I gave you gonorrhea

558
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:53,129
because I thought
you'd have fun with it.

559
00:20:53,163 --> 00:20:55,329
Hey, hey,
I'm with someone.

560
00:20:55,363 --> 00:20:58,496
Oh. Hello.

561
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:00,229
No, I understand.

562
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:02,363
This could be
a tough thing to deal with.

563
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:04,863
The important thing
is that you have a partner

564
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,263
who's supportive.

565
00:21:06,296 --> 00:21:07,829
You know...

566
00:21:07,863 --> 00:21:10,629
she's right.

567
00:21:10,663 --> 00:21:12,629
Unfortunately,
I didn't have a partner.

568
00:21:12,663 --> 00:21:14,896
I got gonorrhea
from a tractor.

569
00:21:16,263 --> 00:21:18,863
You got gonorrhea
from a tractor?

570
00:21:18,896 --> 00:21:21,963
And you call that
the tractor story?

571
00:21:21,996 --> 00:21:24,129
You can't get it
from that.

572
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:26,429
But I did. My boyfriend
said I got gonorrhea

573
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:28,263
from riding the tractor
in my bathing suit.

574
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:30,963
All right,
that's it for me.

575
00:21:30,996 --> 00:21:32,429
You've been great.

576
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:34,563
Good night, everybody.

579
00:21:57,096 --> 00:22:00,529
Would you mind helping me out
with some of this stuff?!

580
00:22:00,563 --> 00:22:03,429
You seem like you got
a pretty good handle on it.

581
00:22:03,463 --> 00:22:05,129
No, I don't!

582
00:22:05,163 --> 00:22:08,363
Don't you even care?
This is your company.

583
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:11,229
It's your name on the outside
of the building.

584
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,229
Speaking of which,
the R fell off,

585
00:22:13,263 --> 00:22:14,261
and all it says now
is K-uger.

586
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:15,963
and all it says now
is K-uger.

587
00:22:15,996 --> 00:22:18,963
K-uger? That sounds like one of
those old-time car horns, huh?

588
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:21,529
[IMITATING CAR HORN]
K-uger. K-uger.

589
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:24,196
Oh-ho. Ho!

590
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:27,629
You are too much,
Mr. Kruger. Too much.

591
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:28,929
Thank you, George.

592
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:30,729
You've been great.
That's it for me.

593
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:33,729
No, no. You're not going out on
a high note with me, Mr. Kruger.

594
00:22:33,763 --> 00:22:35,663
[IMITATING CAR HORN]
It's K-uger.

595
00:22:35,696 --> 00:22:37,996
No. No!

596
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:39,696
Good night, everybody.
