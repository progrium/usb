on a bus when I was 14.

174
00:05:32,342 --> 00:05:35,775
I was flying to Chicago
last week on a plane,

175
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:37,208
"Make sure you hang onto
your jacket."

176
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:39,275
There's no way you can
get in touch with them?

177
00:05:39,308 --> 00:05:40,842
Yeah, I'll call them
on their car phone.

178
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,475
Huh, what do you think
it would take

179
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,877
for his parents
to get a car phone?

180
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:44,108
for his parents
to get a car phone?

181
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:45,308
Hypnosis
by aliens.

182
00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:47,108
Where the hell
is this car, Kramer?

183
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:48,508
We need
a system.

184
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:49,842
Well, it's gotta
be here.

185
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,375
Wh--? Why are they using
so many colors?

186
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:54,342
The numbers go up to 40.

187
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:56,875
Maybe it's not
on this level.

188
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:00,675
What?

189
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,975
There's four
different levels.

190
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:04,008
Maybe we're on
the wrong level.

191
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:05,642
How long was
the escalator ride up?

192
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:07,475
I-- It felt like
a couple of levels.

193
00:06:07,508 --> 00:06:09,642
You should always bring
a pad and a pen.

194
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:10,942
I can't carry a pen.

195
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:12,675
I'm afraid
I'll puncture my scrotum.

196
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,877
I got a pen.

197
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:14,042
I got a pen.

198
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:16,442
Where is the bathroom
in this mall?

199
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:19,675
With 600 stores,
I didn't see one bathroom.

200
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,875
What is this?
Like, a joke?

201
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:22,308
Don't they consult
with urologists

202
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:24,675
when they build
one of these places?

203
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:28,442
What's with you?

204
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:29,808
My ear itches.

205
00:06:29,842 --> 00:06:30,808

Hey, don't you dare

206
00:06:30,842 --> 00:06:32,708
talk to me like that,
you hear me?

207
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:34,108
I told you

208
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:35,108
I don't care.

209
00:06:35,142 --> 00:06:36,642
Ow!
You'll have to wait.

210
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:39,608
Hey, hey, is that
really necessary?

211
00:06:39,642 --> 00:06:41,142

Well, I think hitting
a defenseless child

a defenseless child

You are.
You are.

That's what you think.

No, no, no.

All right, that's it.

226
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,508
From now on, no more
calling out "I found it"

227
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,175
unless we're sitting
in it, okay?

228
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,475
Jerry,
look at my fish.

00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:13,877
His eyes look
a little cloudy.

His eyes look
a little cloudy.

00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:18,175
Oh, those are
your eyes.

233
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,275
Oh, they are gonna be
furious.

Who's got the tickets?

235
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,275

236
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,475
I thought
you knew this mall.

237
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:24,642
You said you'd
been here before.

238
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:26,142
Ah, it was easy
last time.

239
00:07:26,175 --> 00:07:28,642
Okay, my fish are dying
right in front of me.

240
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:29,708
We've gotta
get someone

241
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:31,142
to drive us around
the parking lot

242
00:07:31,175 --> 00:07:32,508
to help us
look for the car.

No one's gonna
do that.

Excuse me. Hi.

Um, we can't seem
to find our car.

246
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:41,775

it would be possible,

00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:42,975
if you're not
in a hurry,

Excuse me.
Excuse me.

No, I can't.

I'm too cautious?

have to?

I've been in and out
of hospitals my whole life.

I have no control
over it.

298

Doctors have told me
that when I feel it,

is just release it.

I'm saying to you?

that if I don't go,

Oh, so you don't care if I die?

What I care about

311
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,775
is the sanitary condition
of the parking facility.

Why would I do it
unless I was in mortal danger?

00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:06,275
I know it's against the law.

314

I don't know.

315
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:08,508
Because I could get

and die. That's why.

00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:18,542
The shame,
the humiliation?

You know, I've been issued
a public urination pass

320

because of my condition.

Unbelievable.

I'm never gonna get
outta here.

328
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,808
A guy goes to pee
and never comes back.

329
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:45,375
It's like
a science fiction story.

330
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:48,375
Maybe he went
to one of the other levels.

331
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:49,608
I'm gonna go look for him.

00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:50,642
Oh, now
you're gonna go?

333
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:51,842
I'll be back
in five minutes.

00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,675
If you go now, I know
what's gonna happen.

335
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,308
We'll find the car,
Jerry will show up,

336
00:10:55,342 --> 00:10:56,357
and we'll never
find you.

337
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:56,475
and we'll never
find you.

338
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:58,508
I'll be right back.

339
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:01,108
What's
the difference?

340
00:11:01,142 --> 00:11:03,075
We'll all be
ead eventually.

341
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,675
Does that bother you?

342
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:09,442
Yeah, it bothers me.

343
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:10,808
Doesn't it bother you?

344
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:12,975
Not at all.

345
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:14,642
You see, now,
that bothers me even more

346
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:15,642
than dying bothers me,

347
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,642
because it's people
like you

348
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,642
who live to be 120

349
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:19,375
because you're
not bothered by it.
