1
00:00:01,533 --> 00:00:03,234
There's something insincere
about these greeting cards

2
00:00:03,268 --> 00:00:04,934
that we send
to each other all the time.

3
00:00:04,968 --> 00:00:09,734
They're like these paper,
emotional prostitutes, isn't it?

4
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:11,234
I don't know
what my feelings are,

5
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:13,501
so I'll pay some
total stranger a buck

6
00:00:13,534 --> 00:00:17,368
to make up this Hallmark hooker
to do job for me.

7
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:21,234
So I can go, "I didn't write
this, but whatever they wrote,

8
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:23,234
I think the same thing."

9
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:25,234
Wouldn't it be better
if we just had one card

10
00:00:25,268 --> 00:00:28,234
that covered every occasion
for everybody in one shot?

11
00:00:28,268 --> 00:00:30,000
Just: "Happy birthday, merry
Christmas, happy anniversary,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,868
Just: "Happy birthday, merry
Christmas, happy anniversary,

13
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:34,168
congratulations, it's a boy
and our deepest sympathies.

14
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,234
Signed, the whole office."

15
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:43,868
ELAINE:
She was hitting on you?

16
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:46,034
My friend, Noreen?

17
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:47,834
Your friend, Noreen.

18
00:00:47,868 --> 00:00:49,668
You're not just
flattering yourself?

19
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:51,934
If I was flattering myself,
I think I'd come up with

20
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,868
someone a little
less annoying than Noreen.

21
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:58,401
I cannot believe
she was hitting on you.

22
00:00:58,434 --> 00:00:59,868
If you don't
believe me, ask her.

23
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:01,334
I will.

24
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:04,501
Besides, she's got a boyfriend,
Jerry, you know him: Dan.

25
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:06,601
Remember we went to
that party at his house?

26
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:09,034
Right, the guy who talks
with the really high voice.

27
00:01:10,534 --> 00:01:12,834
Jerry, did you get my
<i>Fortune</i> magazine in your mail?

28
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:14,168
Check the pile.

29
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:15,201
Oh.

30
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:19,834
Ooh, who sent
you a card?

31
00:01:19,868 --> 00:01:21,268
I don't know.
Open it.

32
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:22,501
It's from Hallmark.

33
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:23,534
Oh.

34
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:25,501
Hello, my love.

35
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:28,068
Hello, darling.

36
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:29,201
Isn't that cute?

37
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:30,501
A thank-you card from Kristin.

38
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:32,534
Here, let me see.

39
00:01:32,568 --> 00:01:33,534
Who's Kristin?

40
00:01:33,568 --> 00:01:34,668
She works for PBS.

41
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:36,668
I met her when I agreed
to do that pledge drive.

42
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:38,001
Did you ask her
about me? Yeah.

43
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:39,414
In fact, she said you
could be one of those people

44
00:01:39,414 --> 00:01:40,234
In fact, she said you
could be one of those people

45
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,101
that sits in the back
and answers the phone.

46
00:01:42,134 --> 00:01:43,234
Giddy up.

47
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:44,868
All right. So, now,
how does that work?

48
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:47,868
I get a percentage of every
pledge I bring in, right?

49
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:51,901
No. It's not aluminum siding.
It's volunteer work.

50
00:01:51,934 --> 00:01:54,001
All the money goes
to the station. Uh-huh.

51
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:55,334
Okay.
Yeah, all right.

52
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:57,568
That sounds good, but I still
get a tote bag though.

53
00:01:57,601 --> 00:01:59,368
And one of those
foam beer can holders.

54
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,601
Ooh.
Hmm-hm, honk.

55
00:02:03,634 --> 00:02:05,234
You know what I'm doing?

56
00:02:05,268 --> 00:02:07,768
I'm calling Noreen.
Oh, go ahead.

57
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,414
You sure you don't mind?
Like she's really gonna admit

58
00:02:09,414 --> 00:02:10,268
You sure you don't mind?
Like she's really gonna admit

59
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:11,668
she was flirting with me.

Noreen's not here.

00:02:34,234 --> 00:02:35,534
This is Dan.

Elaine, what is going on?

Why did you tell Dan I was
hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?

00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:14,401
Is this Noreen?

89
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:19,034
What would possess you
to make up a story like that?

90
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:21,934
Listen, Jerry mentioned it,
and I didn't--

91
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,534
I think I deserve
an explanation.

92
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:27,768
Ahh, Noreen, are you crying?

00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:32,068
No, this is Dan.

Um.

00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,414
Uh, tell Noreen I'll
call her back later.

98
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:40,868
Uh, tell Noreen I'll
call her back later.

00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:43,868

No one. I'm sorry,

I'm sure it won't.

103
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:51,601
But someone was crying,
and I want to know who it was.

104
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:55,001
ELAINE:
Well, it's a long story. Okay.

105
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:59,334
But my stupid friend, Jerry,
told my other friend, Noreen,

106
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:01,134
that she was--

107
00:04:04,868 --> 00:04:06,101
You know, hitting on him.

108
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:09,414
And so I called her
to see...what was going on.

109
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:11,268
And so I called her
to see...what was going on.

110
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:15,101
And I accidentally got
her boyfriend, who is this...

111
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:16,134
You know...

112
00:04:19,534 --> 00:04:22,668
"I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
I tell jokes for a living,

113
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:27,168
"but there's no joking about
the financial crisis at PBS.

114
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:30,701
Show us you care.
Call in your pledge now."

115
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:34,501

that you're doing this.

You got the card I sent?
I did.

118
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:39,414
So where is it?

119
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:40,768
So where is it?

120
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:42,601
What?

121
00:04:42,634 --> 00:04:43,634
The card?

122
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:49,101
Is this it,
in the trash?

123
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:52,968
No.

00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:56,101
This is my card.

125
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:57,368
You threw it away?

00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:58,601
Well--

127
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:01,168
I put a lot of thought
into this card.

128
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,268
You signed your name
and addressed the envelope.

129
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:06,934
It's not like you painted
the picture and wrote the poem.

130
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:09,414
Fine.

131
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:09,968
Fine.

132
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:12,501
I gotta get back
to the office.

133
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:13,934
Why? Because I threw
the card out?

134
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:16,068
How long was
I supposed to save it?

135
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:18,068
You have
no sentimentality.

136
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:19,434
I have
sentimentality.

137
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:21,001
Really,
I'm sentimental.

138
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:23,068
Here, look.
Here's some cards I've saved.

139
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:25,068
These are birthday cards
from my grandmother.

140
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:26,068
See, I'm
not a bad guy.

141
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:28,101
You save her cards
but not mine.

142
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:29,168
Oh, great.

143
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:32,168
But you see,
I saved something.

144
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:35,068
See, I can save.

145
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,068
I'll see you
at the pledge drive, okay?

146
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:39,414
Well...
New cards, huh?

147
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:40,601
Well...
New cards, huh?

148
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:43,701
No, they're old cards
from my grandmother.

149
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:46,768
Well, I'll tell you,
a nice greeting card

150
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:48,401
can really lift
a person's spirits.

151
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:49,434
Yeah.

152
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:53,901
Oh. Ooh.
A check?

153
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:55,934
She puts $10 in every
card for my birthday.

154
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:56,934
That's why I save them.

155
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:58,168
There's a check in all these?

156
00:05:58,201 --> 00:05:59,601
Why don't you cash them.

157
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:01,368
I don't know, it's $10.

158
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:03,234
Yeah, but you got
a whole pile here.

159
00:06:03,268 --> 00:06:04,834
1987?

160
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:05,934
Oh, so what?

161
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:08,168
Jerry, your grandmother
gave you this gift.

162
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,414
She wants to you
to spend the money,

163
00:06:09,414 --> 00:06:09,701
She wants to you
to spend the money,

164
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,734
to have the fun
that she can't have.

165
00:06:11,768 --> 00:06:13,934
This is tantamount
to a slap in the face.

166
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:15,201
Oh, get out of here.

167
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:17,101
Jerry, a gift not enjoyed

168
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:19,534
is like a flower
that doesn't blossom.

169
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:23,468
All right, all right,
I'll cash the checks.

170
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:27,534
JERRY:
It was a thank-you card from Kristin

171
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:29,834
because I'm doing
the PBS drive.

172
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:31,834
I mean, how long
am supposed to keep it?

with Jerry.

527
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:04,737
You again, buddy?

528
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:06,304
Look, forget about Jerry.

529
00:21:06,337 --> 00:21:07,504
It's not gonna happen.

530
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:07,799
This is his grandmother.

531
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,304
This is his grandmother.

532
00:21:09,337 --> 00:21:13,004
Oh, uh, Nana, hello.

533
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:14,237
Tell Jerry I'm sorry.

534
00:21:14,271 --> 00:21:16,804
I'm going to have to write him
some new checks.

535
00:21:16,837 --> 00:21:18,404
As long as you got
your checkbook out,

536
00:21:18,437 --> 00:21:20,837
how about forking
a little over to PBS.

537
00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:22,304
You watch the station,
don't you?

538
00:21:22,337 --> 00:21:23,637
<i>Don't be a freeloader.</i>

539
00:21:23,671 --> 00:21:26,571
...programs like
Ken Burn's <i>Baseball,</i>

540
00:21:26,604 --> 00:21:30,704
and if Danny Tartabull were
here, I'm sure he'd say,

541
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:32,571
"That's correct, Jerry."

542
00:21:32,604 --> 00:21:34,371
Jerry, I have
an announcement.

543
00:21:34,404 --> 00:21:35,904
Your grandmother
is on the line.

544
00:21:35,937 --> 00:21:37,137
My nana?

545
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:37,799
And as we speak,
she's generously writing PBS

546
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,737
And as we speak,
she's generously writing PBS

547
00:21:39,771 --> 00:21:41,571
a check for $1500.

548
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:44,571
She can't do that!

549
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:48,204
She's on a very
fixed income!

550
00:21:48,237 --> 00:21:50,204
Stop the show.

551
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:58,171
I got another card
from Kristin,

552
00:21:58,204 --> 00:22:02,404
not quite as chipper
as the first one.

553
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:06,504
Isn't this little bunny
giving you the--

554
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:08,637
Yes, he is.

555
00:22:08,671 --> 00:22:10,504
You should show this to Georgie.
Yeah.

556
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,004
Here's your knife and fork.

557
00:22:13,904 --> 00:22:17,004
Look, she's cutting up
an Almond Joy.

558
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:18,504
I just don't get it.

559
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,771
I saw someone on the street
eating M&M's with a spoon.

560
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:27,404
What is wrong
with everybody?

561
00:22:27,437 --> 00:22:29,171
Look, they're doing it.

562
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:30,904
They're all doing it.

563
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:35,437
What is wrong
with all you people?

564
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:38,871
Have you all gone mad?
