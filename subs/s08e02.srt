536
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:40,282
and someone crying out,
"Dear God!"

537
00:20:41,848 --> 00:20:44,982
Let's start with, uh...

538
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:46,382
With you, Wyck.

539
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:49,815
George,

540
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,482
Quinn here was moving a chair.

541
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:54,515
He lost his balance
and dropped it.

542
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:56,182
It must have fallen
on your briefcase,

543
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:57,482
which for some reason,

544
00:20:57,515 --> 00:20:58,044
contained a running
tape recorder.

545
00:20:58,044 --> 00:20:59,082
contained a running
tape recorder.

546
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:10,148
All right then.

547
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:12,482
We've gotten
to the bottom of that.

548
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:13,848
[♪]

549
00:21:16,348 --> 00:21:17,448
Uh--

550
00:21:19,182 --> 00:21:20,882
What are you guys
doing here?

551
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:22,682
We're getting vasectomies.

552
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:25,215
[LAUGHING]
Why?

553
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:26,782
I'm doing it for you.

554
00:21:27,415 --> 00:21:28,044
What?

555
00:21:28,044 --> 00:21:28,382
What?

556
00:21:28,415 --> 00:21:29,848
What'd you do
to your hair?

557
00:21:29,882 --> 00:21:31,882
I cut it.

558
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,315
It's a little short.

559
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:34,782
You think?

560
00:21:36,448 --> 00:21:37,715
What are you doing here?

561
00:21:37,748 --> 00:21:39,982
Kevin's having
his vasectomy reversed.

562
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:41,382
Reversed?
Reversed?

563
00:21:42,248 --> 00:21:43,415
[GASPING]

564
00:21:47,782 --> 00:21:49,748
[♪]

565
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:05,991
He imbibed her glistening spell

566
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:09,791
Just before the other shoe fell

567
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:15,158
Is that a Keats poem?

568
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:16,825
No, it's a Newman.

569
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:18,391
[QUIETLY]
Newman.

570
00:22:19,391 --> 00:22:20,891
Well, I gotta run.

571
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:29,819
Does anyone think George
might have murdered Susan?

572
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:31,658
Does anyone think George
might have murdered Susan?

573
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:35,125
Oh, yeah, I just assumed
he murdered her.

574
00:22:35,158 --> 00:22:36,791
Of course
he killed her.

575
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:38,125
So it's not just me then.

576
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:40,491
All right.
Back to business.

577
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,125
