just the two of us,

530
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,852
and we surrendered
to temptation.

531
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:13,650
And it was pretty good.

532
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,052
And it was pretty good.

533
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:18,885
Yeah, but he didn't sleep
with both of 'em.

534
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,885
But I never heard
her cries for help,

535
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,385
and now Susie is gone.

536
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:34,985
MIKE:
Hold on! Hold on.

537
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:37,819
Susie didn't commit suicide.

538
00:21:37,852 --> 00:21:40,719
She was murdered...

by Jerry Seinfeld!

540
00:21:45,252 --> 00:21:47,819
Not only that,
I broke his thumbs.

541
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:49,785

542
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:01,052
PETERMAN:
Elaine, guess what.

543
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:04,419
I've decided to form
a charitable foundation

544
00:22:04,452 --> 00:22:06,019
in Susie's honor,

545
00:22:06,052 --> 00:22:09,085
and as Susie's best friend,
I want you to be involved.

546
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,752
Mr. Peterman...

547
00:22:12,785 --> 00:22:15,152
I'm Susie.

548
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:16,852
She's me.

549
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:21,185
I feel the same way.

550
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:25,919
And that's why this foundation
will meet around your schedule.

551
00:22:25,952 --> 00:22:27,566
Nights, weekends,
every free moment you have.

552
00:22:27,566 --> 00:22:29,585
Nights, weekends,
every free moment you have.

553
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:37,019
Suz!
