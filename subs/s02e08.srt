No, actually, we'd like

just to be safe.

There's nothing wrong with me.

Well, I wouldn't go
that far.

grow back?

Because no one in my family
has their tonsils.

one more... question.

I never felt better in my life."

533
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:47,366
Medical science
is making advances every day

534
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,333
to control health problems.

535
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:51,500

only a matter of time

536
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:54,500

We'll just see people on TV
going,

538
00:21:57,033 --> 00:22:00,666

00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:04,533
"Clear! Boom--

541
00:22:06,087 --> 00:22:07,467
and it's gone!"

542
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,267
