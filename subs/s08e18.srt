00:00:09,366 --> 00:00:10,733

5
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:12,666
Literally, the slaughter
of a man.

6

Sounds brutal,
doesn't it? Heinous.

7
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:18,166
Yet it's the most socially
acceptable form of murder. Huh.

8

change the name.

Uh... "unintentional
snuff-out."

13
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:29,500
How about "I can't believe
it's not murder"?

Oh, boy. I was up
till 4 in the morning

the devil's son, right?

19
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:45,466
I thought he was
the devil's helper.

20
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,600
Well, he's pretty scary
for a helper.
