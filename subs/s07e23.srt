00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:04,333
The whole concept of being
separated, to me, is strange.

2
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:06,533
It's like your engaged
to be divorced.

00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:09,866
We're gonna try and make
not being together work.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,500
First we were separated,
then we met,

5
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:12,700
and then we were together,

6
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:15,033
and now we're gonna try
being separated again.

7
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:17,133
We think actually some sort of
giant rubber band

8
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,700
might be the solution.

9
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:20,366
Of course,
when you were a kid in school,

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,133
you'd get separated
for having too good a time.

11
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,700
If you two kids don't stop
laughing and having fun,

12
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,766
I'm gonna have to separate you.

13
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:29,666
Then the kid finds out

14
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,000
his parents are breaking up,
and he thinks

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,533
his parents are breaking up,
and he thinks

16
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:33,500
it's because they got caught
fooling around,

17
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,066

this whole thing
is George's fault.

the thing about George

526
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:50,678
And here.

529
00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:54,245
Excuse me.
Hm.

530
00:20:58,745 --> 00:20:59,712
Beth?

531
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:00,745
David.

532
00:21:07,078 --> 00:21:08,612
Ow.

533
00:21:09,512 --> 00:21:10,778
I'll tell you, it's not bad.

534
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:16,512

535
00:21:31,178 --> 00:21:32,845
George?
Yeah?

536
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:34,145
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

537
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:36,512
Yeah, sure. Sure.

538
00:21:38,078 --> 00:21:39,478
I've been doing
a lot of thinking

539
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:41,178
about the wedding and all,
and, um...

540
00:21:43,778 --> 00:21:44,778
[SIGHS]

541
00:21:46,578 --> 00:21:48,278
I've decided
to go with the chicken.

543
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:05,878
Hi.

544
00:22:05,912 --> 00:22:08,345
So chasing little kids,
huh?

545
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:09,860
You're in a lot of trouble,
mister.

546
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:12,593
No, look. I was babysitting--
Yeah, yeah. All right.

547
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:13,626
Sit down.

548
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:21,593
What are you, deaf?
I said sit down.

549
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,360
Hey, for the last time,
sit down.

550
00:22:30,393 --> 00:22:30,611
Oh, yeah.

551
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:32,060
Oh, yeah.
