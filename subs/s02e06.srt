All right, tomorrow, 1:00.

352
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,100
Great. Okay, bye.

353
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,400
All right, look.
Look, look, look.

354
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:50,900
Let's say he stole it.

355
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:52,366
Oh, he stole it.

356
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,466
You-- You can't do anything
about it.

357
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,200
The cops won't do anything.

358
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,800
What, are you gonna
go fight him?

359

Why don't you
just forget it.

360

No.
No.

361

362
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,366
Relax. He's late.

363
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,233
He's always late.
It's part of his m.o.

364
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:19,166
Remember, don't take
any crap.

365
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,133
Yeah, yeah.
Don't worry about it.

That's comforting.

00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,366
Shh. He's coming.

368
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,900
Ray.

369
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:29,333
Oh. Jerry.

370
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:32,166
I can't believe you asked me
about that statue.

you could've gotten me into?

Well, I--

373

Rava was standing
right next me.

00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:37,466
Rava was standing
right next me.

375
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,700
I never told her
where I got the statue.

376
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,033
I wonder why.
Well, just give it back

Yeah, me.

You already got it.

in my house.

You were in my house.

388
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,200
And then I saw it
in your house.

What are you saying?
What am I saying?

Take a wild guess.

392
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,566
Are you saying
I stole your statue?

393
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,066
What a mind.
Well, I--

394
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,800
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

397
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,900
For your information,
I got that statue in a pawnshop.

398
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:23,666
Pawnshop?
A pawnshop?

399
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,866
Yes, in Chinatown,

00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,366
with the money
I earned cleaning apartments.

Oh, excuse me.

Yeah.

403

Look, Ray, you were
the only person in my house.

404
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:36,035

It's Rava, isn't it?

No, she's a little
too cheery for me.

No, actually, I find you
quite charming.

00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,633
I said, "luss."

I am proofreading
a food-allergy cookbook.

00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:26,366
Can't you talk to your boss?
I did.

529
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,900
He loves Rava.

530
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,366
Worse, he loves Ray.

531
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,366
And he doesn't think
you're funny at all.

532
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:36,035
I'm not happy about this.

533
00:19:36,035 --> 00:19:37,566
I'm not happy about this.

534
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,033
Well, perhaps we can take
comfort in the knowledge

535
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:43,133
that in the next world,
Ray will be the recipient

536
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,666
of a much larger and more harsh
brand of justice.

537
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,600
Yeah, he'll have my parents.

Hey. Hey, are you

Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop.

Got you? I don't know
