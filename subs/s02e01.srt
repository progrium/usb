"the waiting room,"

I'm getting her magazine."

And then they finally call you,
and it's a very exciting moment.

363
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,740
They finally call you,
and you stand up,

364
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:56,274
and you kind of look around
at the other people in the room,

you're going to see the doctor,

I most certainly did.

527
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:54,040
And he said, he goes, "Oh, yeah,
you're Jeanette's friend.

528
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,907
We did meet once."

529
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,907
And I said, "Well, how do you go
from that

530
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,007
to ignoring a person
when they walk by?"

531
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,207
This is amazing.

532
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,440
And he says-- he says,

533
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:06,240
"Look, I just didn't want to say
hello anymore, all right?"

534
00:18:06,274 --> 00:18:08,514
And I said, "Fine! Fine!

535
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:08,940
And I said, "Fine! Fine!

536
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:11,107
"I didn't want to say hello
anymore either,

537
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,640
but I wanted you to know
that I'm aware of it."

538
00:18:16,474 --> 00:18:19,440
You are
the queen of confrontation.

539
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,674
You're my new hero.

540
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:22,907
In fact,
you've inspired me.

541
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,007
I'm going to call George
about something right now.

542
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,440
Oh...

543
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:30,274
This cantaloupe stinks.

544
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,207
I don't care.

545
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,514
You're kidding?

546
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:39,540
You're kidding?

547
00:18:39,574 --> 00:18:40,607
No. I don't care.

548
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,607
You mean that?

549
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,607
Absolutely.

550
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,374
You don't care?
No.

551
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:45,440
How could you not care?

552
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:47,874
I don't know, but I don't.

553
00:18:47,907 --> 00:18:49,507
I'm actually
almost happy to hear it.

554
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,940
I thought you'd be upset.

555
00:18:51,974 --> 00:18:54,540
Well, I guess I should be,
but I'm not.

556
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:57,040
Am I a bad person?
Did I do something terrible?

557
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:58,107
You're a fine person.

558
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,540
You're a humanitarian.

559
00:18:59,574 --> 00:19:01,440
She's very sexy.

560
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,674
That voice, that voice.
She's driving me crazy.

561
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,240
I know. I know.

562
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:07,374
So I can see her tonight
and you don't care?

563
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:08,514
See her tonight,
see her tomorrow. Go.

564
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,174
See her tonight,
see her tomorrow. Go.

565
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:10,607
Knock yourself out.

566
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,507
She's too crazy
for me.

567
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,740
All right, as long
as you're okay.

568
00:19:13,774 --> 00:19:15,240
Because I can't stop
thinking about her.

569
00:19:15,274 --> 00:19:17,840
I'm okay. I'm fine.
I'm wonderful.

570
00:19:17,874 --> 00:19:20,007
I never felt better
in my whole life.

571
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,240
Good.

572
00:19:21,274 --> 00:19:23,840
And I'll tell you what.

573
00:19:23,874 --> 00:19:25,840
You don't have
to pay me back the $35

574
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,907
I gave the chiropractor
for the rest of your bill.

575
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,507
You paid that crook?

576
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,107
I had to.

577
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,040
He didn't do anything!
Jerry, it's a scam!

578
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:35,540
Who told you to do that?

579
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,740
It was embarrassing to me.

580
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:38,507
Oh, I trying to make a point.

581
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,240
Why don't you make a point
with your own doctor?

582
00:19:40,274 --> 00:19:41,240
Yeah, but J--

583
00:19:41,274 --> 00:19:42,240
[HACKING]

584
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:43,340
What's wrong?

585
00:19:43,374 --> 00:19:45,674
I think I swallowed a fly.

586
00:19:45,707 --> 00:19:48,040
Oh, God.

587
00:19:48,074 --> 00:19:49,574
I swallowed a fly!

588
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:52,707
What do I do? What can happen?

589
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:01,374
So, you want to come up
for a few minutes?

590
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,240
I'm sorry, Jerry.

591
00:20:03,274 --> 00:20:05,340
I just don't think
this is gonna work.

592
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:07,207
Really?

593
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,340
I thought--

594
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:08,514
I know.

595
00:20:08,514 --> 00:20:09,340
I know.

596
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,074
I'm sorry.

597
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,074
Gee... I just
didn't expect it

598
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:16,740
from the way
you've been acting.

599
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:18,240
Are you sure you want
to talk about this?

600
00:20:18,274 --> 00:20:19,740
Because I sure don't.

601
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:22,607
Of course I want
to talk about it.

602
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,340
Well, okay.

603
00:20:24,374 --> 00:20:25,574
I guess things
changed for me

604
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:27,207
on Tuesday night.

605
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,574
Tuesday night?

606
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:30,074
What happened
Tuesday night?

607
00:20:30,107 --> 00:20:33,207
I saw your act.

608
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:37,074
My act?

609
00:20:37,107 --> 00:20:38,514
What does that
have to do with anything?

610
00:20:38,514 --> 00:20:39,040
What does that
have to do with anything?

611
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:44,407
Well, to be honest,
it just didn't make it for me.

612
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,274
It's just so much fluff.

613
00:20:47,307 --> 00:20:49,507
I can't believe this.

614
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,174
So what are you saying?
You didn't like my act?

615
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:54,174
So that's it?

616
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:57,374
I can't be with someone
if I don't respect what they do.

617
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:59,274
You're a cashier.

618
00:21:01,474 --> 00:21:03,040
Look, Jerry,
it wasn't my kind of humor.

619
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:07,440
You can't go by the audience
that night.

620
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,514
It was late.
They were terrible.

621
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:09,040
It was late.
They were terrible.

622
00:21:09,074 --> 00:21:11,374
I heard the material.

623
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:14,040
I have other stuff.

624
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:18,340
You should come see me
on the weekend.

625
00:21:18,374 --> 00:21:24,207
Women need to like the job
of the guy they're with.

626
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,340
If they don't like the job,
they don't like the guy.

627
00:21:26,374 --> 00:21:28,674
Men know this.

628
00:21:28,707 --> 00:21:31,040
Which is why we make up

629
00:21:31,074 --> 00:21:35,040
the phony, bogus names
for the jobs that we have.

630
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:36,207
"Right now,

631
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,440
"I'm the regional
management supervisor.

632
00:21:38,474 --> 00:21:38,514
I'm in development,
research, consulting."

633
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:40,540
I'm in development,
research, consulting."

634
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:42,374
Men, on the other hand,

635
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:46,374
if they are physically attracted
to a woman,

636
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:49,740
are not that concerned
with her job, are we?

637
00:21:49,774 --> 00:21:51,174
Men don't really care.

638
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:52,340
Men will just go,

639
00:21:52,374 --> 00:21:53,607
"Really? Slaughterhouse?
Is that where you work?

640
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,907
"That sounds interesting.

641
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,740
"So, what,
you got a big cleaver there?

642
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:57,740
"You just
lopping their heads off?

643
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,740
"That sounds great.

644
00:21:58,774 --> 00:22:01,774
"Listen,
why don't you shower up,

645
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:04,140
and we'll get some burgers
and catch a movie?"
