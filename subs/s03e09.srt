1
00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:05,633
You give me an explanation as
to why the pharmacist has to be

2
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:09,366
two and a half feet up
above everybody else.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,800
What the hell is he doing,

4
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:13,233
he can't be down there
on the floor with you and me?

5
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:15,966
Brain surgeons, airline pilots,
nuclear physicists,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,466
we're all on the same level.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,800
Oh, no, he's gotta be
two and a half feet up.

8
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:24,633
"Look out, everybody,
I'm working with pills.

9
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,166
Spread out, give me some room."

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,000
The only hard part of
his whole job that I could see,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,133
The only hard part of
his whole job that I could see,

12
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:33,466
is typing everything
onto that little, tiny label.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,200
And has to try and get
all the words on there,

14
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:37,633
keep the paper and

15
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,033
the little piece of paper
in the roller of the typewriter.

16
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:43,300
Oh, no. He's gotta be
two and a half feet up.

17
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:47,833
"Yeah, I'd like to get this,
uh, prescription filled."

18
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:51,533
"All right. You wait down there.

19
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:53,400
Only I'm allowed up here."

20
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:00,966
Where'd you
meet her?

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,300
I met her on an elevator.

22
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,666
On an elevator?

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,300
You met a woman
on an elevator?

24
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,700
Impossible, right?

25
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,400
You got less than
60 seconds.

26
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:10,966
That's like dismantling
a time bomb.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,066
What got into you?

28
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,866
I don't know.
She was so beautiful,

29
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,633
it was like
a pure reflex.

30
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,300
The words just
came out of my mouth.

31
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,100
Wow. What did
you say?

32
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:21,200
[COUGHS]

33
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:22,400
You know, I'm the one
responsible

34
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:24,600
for those crop circles
in England.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,098
Wow.

36
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:26,966
Wow.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,333
Can you believe
I did that?

38
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:29,466
What did she say?

39
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,166
What crop circles?

40
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:34,633
[SIGHS]
Not a good sign.

41
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:37,533
Not everybody knows
what the crop circles are.

42
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:39,300
You know what
the crop circles are?

43
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,533
Crop circles?
Why don't you buy something?

44
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:43,533
You got something
in your teeth there.

45
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:44,700
What?

46
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:45,800
It's green.

47
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,133
Oh, man, spinach.

48
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:50,066
I've been walking around
like this all afternoon.

49
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,466
Did you bump into
anybody you knew?

50
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,300
I had a job interview.

51
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,098
How did it go?
Take a guess.

52
00:01:56,098 --> 00:01:56,866
How did it go?
Take a guess.

53
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,166
Well, Mr. Costanza,

54
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
we have nothing available
at the present time

55
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,700
but should anything open up,

56
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:02,700
we'll be in touch.

57
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:04,333
Okay, thanks.

58
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:07,900
Ah, you don't need a job.
You got Audrey.

59
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:10,400
Yeah. Right.

60
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:11,500
What's the matter?

61
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:12,666
No. Nothing.

62
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,300
What?

63
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,800
You won't think
I'm a bad person?

64
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,400
Too late for that.

65
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:19,033
Because, believe me,
I would only say this

66
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:21,500
to you and maybe
a psychiatrist. Maybe.

67
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:23,466
What is it?

68
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,066
Well...

69
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Her nose is
a little big.

70
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,666
Yeah, she's got
a big nose.

71
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:35,800
I mean, big would
even be okay.

72
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,233
It's a little
beyond big.

73
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:38,533
JERRY:
<i>Mmm.</i>

74
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,866
It's a schnoz.

75
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,400
Now I'm aware that my own
physical dimensions

76
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:45,333
are perhaps a little short
of perfection.

77
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:46,966
A little.
So who am I

78
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,833
to be thinking
about someone's nose?

79
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:50,033
I mean, I-I-I should be
grateful

80
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:51,466
someone like her
even looks at me.

81
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,800
I have no job,
nothing.

82
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,966
But I have to say,
I think about the nose.

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,098
I don't wanna
think about the nose,

84
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:57,366
I don't wanna
think about the nose,

85
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,966
I don't ask
to think about the nose,

86
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,033
but I think about it.

87
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:01,533
I go to bed,
I tell myself,

88
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:03,500
"Don't think about the nose.
Forget the nose."

89
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,666
But I think about it.

90
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,066
I look at her,
I see...

91
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,366
the nose.

92
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,000
Stop being so concerned
with looks.

93
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,466
Have you said anything
to her about it?

94
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,633
No. I could never
do that.

95
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,033
You know, the ironic thing is,
if she had a smaller nose,

96
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:26,098
I never could've gone out with
her in the first place.

97
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:27,300
I never could've gone out with
her in the first place.

98
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,800
She'd be out of my league
with a smaller nose.

99
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:33,066
And I really like her.
I know that.

100
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,633
And I know
one other thing:

101
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:35,633
[LAUGHS]

102
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,833
I'm not getting past
that nose.

103
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:40,633
All right, shut up.
Here they come.

104
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,633
[GROANS]

105
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,033
How can I
not think about it?

106
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:44,400
Look at the size
of this thing.

107
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,300
KRAMER:
<i>So my mother's going out</i>
<i>with this guy</i>

108
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,800
who leaves a jacket
in her house.

109
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,066
So, you know,
she gives to me.

110
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,400
Well, two years later,

111
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,400
he shows up
and he takes it back.

112
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:56,098
And now he's in prison!

113
00:03:56,098 --> 00:03:57,566
And now he's in prison!

114
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,533
Got arrested for mail fraud.

115
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:01,300
So, Elaine,
all you have to do is

116
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,466
go over
to the apartment,

117
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,466
tell the landlord
that you're his daughter

118
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,466
and you wanna bring him
the jacket in prison.

119
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,233
Won't the landlord know
I'm not the daughter?

120
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:11,833
No, no. he's never met her.
She's in California.

121
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,200
Are you coming with me?

122
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:15,500
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I have to.

123
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:16,500
I'm your fiancé.

124
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,666
Peter Von Nostrand.

125
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,333
Why don't you just
commit yourself already?

126
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,966
Wh-what is so special
about this jacket?

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,098
No, you really don't wanna know.
God.

128
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,133
No, you really don't wanna know.
God.

129
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,300
He believes

130
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,466
it possesses some

131
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,733
extraordinary power
over women.

132
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:34,700
What's that splotch
on your hand?

133
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,800
Oh, I got stamped at
the reggae lounge last night.

134
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,133
Yeah, I'm going
back there tonight.

135
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,400
You know, I'm not gonna pay
another cover charge.

136
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,300
What? You didn't wash
all day?

137
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,833
Yeah, I washed.

138
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,733
Just not the hand.

139
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,166
You wouldn't believe
the women at this club.

140
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,566
Ooh, man.

141
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,466
It's amazing how many
beautiful women

142
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,900
live in New York.

143
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:56,098
I actually find it
kind of intimidating.

144
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:57,800
I actually find it
kind of intimidating.

145
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,733
Well, you're as pretty
as any of them.

146
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:00,900
Just need a nose job.

147
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:07,400
KRAMER:
What?

148
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,800
Kramer!

149
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,300
What? What?

150
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,633
How could you say
something like that?

151
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,800
What? What do you mean?
What?

152
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,400
I just said
she needs a nose job.

153
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:18,233
No, no. There's nothing wrong
with her nose.

154
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:19,966
God, I'm so sorry,
Audrey.

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,200
Oh, it's okay.

156
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:22,966
What did you have
to say that for?

157
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,500
Well, I was just trying
to help out.

158
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,098
Yeah, well, you can kiss that
jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nausen.

159
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:29,866
Yeah, well, you can kiss that
jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nausen.

160
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,000
You see what happens
when you try to be nice?

161
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:37,800
But what would the world be like

162
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,666
if people said whatever
they were thinking...

163
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,300
all the time,
whenever it came to them?

164
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,633
How long would a blind date
last?

165
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,033
About 13 seconds, I think.

166
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:50,700
"Oh, sorry, your rear end
is too big."

167
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,333
"That's okay,
your breath stinks anyway "

168
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:53,666
"See you later.
No problem. Goodbye."

169
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,733
"Okay, thank you very much."

another month

00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03,200
Thinking? Nothing.

00:18:57,866 --> 00:18:59,833
Oh.
My father? Really?

526
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:01,533
I had no idea.

527
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:03,000
Yes, they're crazy
about him.

528
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:04,200
This one
in particular,

529
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:07,066
came around
about two years ago.

530
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,833
Looked a lot like you,
professor.

531
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:10,066
Could have been
your mother.

532
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,133
Hmm, what was
her name again?

533
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:12,547
Uh...

534
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:13,233
Uh...

535
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:15,733
Carter? Counter?
Kramer. That's it.

536
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:19,000
Babs Kramer.
Nasty woman.

537
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,400
Many a night I had to
throw her on the street,

538
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:22,900
drunken stumblebum.

539
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:24,666
You don't say.
I found it!

540
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,666
The woman used to walk
around here half-naked,

541
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,066
sucking Colt .45
from a can.

542
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,133
Her big, fat stomach
hanging out,

543
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,300
orthopedic hose
up to her knees,

544
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,300
screaming down
the hall,

545
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,233
"Come back to bed, Albert,
you big hairy ape!

546
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:42,547
And bring back
that box of Danish!"

547
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:44,166
And bring back
that box of Danish!"

548
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,233
So I grabbed the guy
by the collar.

549
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:48,500
Yeah,
and I yelled out,

550
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:51,133
"Kramer, Kramer,
you're killing him."

551
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,900
So I assume
the jig was up.

552
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:54,300
Yeah, pretty much.
KRAMER: Yeah.

553
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,366
But look...

554
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,466
Uh?
Ooh.

555
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,000
Yes.

556
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,166
Hi. Here are your keys.
ELAINE: Hi. Thank you.

557
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,333
Hello.
GEORGE [STUNNED]: Audrey.

558
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,333
My God, you look incredible.

559
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:09,300
I-I can't believe it.

560
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,633
Well, it was his doctor.

561
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,547
He was wonderful.
Mm-hmm.

562
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:12,566
He was wonderful.
Mm-hmm.

563
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,066
So will I see you
later tonight?

564
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:17,266
Not sure.

565
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,466
Well, I'll, uh...

566
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
check you guys out
later, huh?

567
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:23,566
Ready?

568
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,566
I didn't wash.

569
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,666
Neither did I.

570
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,133
Yyyyoop! Ah.

571
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,600
We're off to
the reggae lounge.

572
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,933
Ah?

573
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,633
My nose, my nose.

574
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,866
My kingdom for a nose.

575
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,547
Boy, isn't she beautiful?
Mm.

576
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:43,000
Boy, isn't she beautiful?
Mm.

577
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,866
Her nose is in such
perfect proportions

578
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,300
to the rest of her face.
Mm.

579
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,533
She's breathtaking.

580
00:20:48,566 --> 00:20:49,733
Who would have thought?
She's, like--?

581
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:51,333
Elaine...

582
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:53,433
shut up.

583
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,300
Hm.

584
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,066
The technical term
for a nose job is...?

585
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,833
AUDIENCE: Rhinoplasty.
Rhinoplasty.

586
00:21:01,866 --> 00:21:04,300
Rhino. Okay?

587
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,200
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

588
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:08,700
Do we really need
to insult the person

589
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:11,366
at this particular moment
of their lives?

590
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,547
They know they have a big nose.

591
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:13,133
They know they have a big nose.

592
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,633
That's why they're coming in.

593
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,166
Do they really need the abuse

594
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,300
of being compared
to a rhinoceros

595
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,833
on top of everything else?

596
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:23,166
When someone has a
hair transplant, they don't go,

597
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,300
"We're going to perform

598
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,466
"a cue ball-ectomy on you,
Mr. Johnson.

599
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,300
"We're going to attempt
to remove the...

600
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,133
"skinheadia of your, uh...

601
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,866
"Your chromedomus,
which is what the--

602
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,833
The technical term."

603
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,933
