1
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:03,233
The worse part about
a car breaking down

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:04,633
is when you're
out on the road,

3
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,466
you're a guy,
'cause now you have to get out

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,533
and pretend like you
know what you're doing.

5
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:12,366
You gotta go,
"All right, honey,

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,500
I'm gonna go check it out."

7
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:17,500
Walk around the front,
open up the hood.

8
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:19,700
That's good
'cause it obscures her view.

9
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:22,000
That's the main reason
you wanna do that.

10
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:23,566
You're lookin' in there.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,233
You know, you're hoping you're
going to see something in there

12
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:29,466
so simple, so obvious,
so incredibly easy to fix,

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,000
even you can handle it,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,833
even you can handle it,

15
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:33,766
like a giant on/off switch
turned off.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,133
So you're going out
with David Puddy?

17
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,200
Yeah.

18
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:42,500
What, is that
a problem?

19
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:44,066
Well, I think
he could have asked me.

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,633
He's supposed to be
a friend of mine.

21
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,466
I guess he figured
you just wouldn't care.

22
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,133
It has been
a few years.

23
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,666
Elaine, you always care
who an ex-girlfriend dates.

24
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,633
You don't want it to be
someone you know,

25
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,700
and you don't want it to be
someone better than you.

26
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:58,133
Now, even though the latter
is obviously impossible...

27
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,133
Oh, God.

28
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,800
...the former still applies.

29
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,166
I don't know
what it is.

30
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,733
I just can't see you
with a mechanic.

31
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:05,300
Oh, yeah,
right, right.

32
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,079
Well, all those mechanics do
is work all day

33
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:07,333
Well, all those mechanics do
is work all day

34
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:10,466
with their hands and their
big muscular arms on machines,

35
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
and then they come home
dripping with animal sexuality

36
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:15,066
like Stanley Kowalski.

37
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,033
What a huge turnoff
that is.

38
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:18,666
All right.

39
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:23,400
Hey, look at that.

40
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:25,200
They got lobster
on the menu.

41
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:27,300
Who would order
a lobster here?

42
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,466
I mean, do they bring
a lobster in every day,

43
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,800
hoping today's the day?

44
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,166
So what if they
have a lobster.

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,079
Suddenly you're
a shellfish connoisseur?

46
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,133
Suddenly you're
a shellfish connoisseur?

47
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,666
You know, I think
we really need

48
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,466
to be in front
of a television set.

49
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,633
You take TV out of
this relationship,

50
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,866
it is just torture.

51
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,900
So...

52
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:51,200
I'm getting
an eye job.

53
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:52,233

need an eye job.

to drive me home

Why doesn't he pick you up
after the operation?

He's got the car with
the bench seats that you like.

instead of the swirl.

Oh, yeah,

Besides, I don't know how you
can trust any of his moves now.

00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,200
His whole repertoire
could be lifted.

00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,466
You know, it's strange because
he's such an honest mechanic.

honest mechanic in New York.

Five foot four.
Why?

220

a one foot differential
