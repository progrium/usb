There's nothing

00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,882
and he lost his glasses,

181
00:06:31,915 --> 00:06:33,948
he squinted his way
from Wurtsboro

182
00:06:33,982 --> 00:06:34,326
down to the Tappan Zee Bridge.

183
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:36,148
down to the Tappan Zee Bridge.

184
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:38,848
He was spottin' raccoons
on the road.

185
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:42,548
Okay.

186
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:44,448
Okay? That's it?

187
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:45,782
I--? I don't need a shot?

188
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:48,648
[THICK ACCENT]
Not shot. Dog bite.

189
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:52,482
No, no, no.
I know I <i>wasn't</i> shot.

190
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:53,948
Do I <i>need</i> a shot?

191
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:57,448
Not shot. Dog bite.

192
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,582
Woof-woof, not bang-bang.

193
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:08,782
Ah, look at this. Cable's out.

194
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:10,615
Oh, that's okay.
We don't have to watch TV.

195
00:07:10,648 --> 00:07:11,982
No, no, no.

196
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,215
No trouble at all.
It's the principle of the thing.

197
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:20,282
I like them to know that
I know what's going on,

198
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,982
that they're not...

199
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:25,048
getting away with anything.

200
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:27,648
Unh, I'm on hold.

201
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,715
So, what'd you do yesterday?

202
00:07:30,748 --> 00:07:32,382
Yesterday?

203
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:34,326
Yeah. You remember yesterday.

204
00:07:34,326 --> 00:07:36,048
Yeah. You remember yesterday.

205
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:39,182
Beautiful day,
good day to be...out.

206
00:07:39,215 --> 00:07:40,982
I didn't do anything.

207
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:43,982
[LAUGHING]
Well, you must've done something.

208
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:47,982
Mmm...no, nothing really.

209
00:07:48,015 --> 00:07:50,715
Didn't go out of the house?

210
00:07:50,748 --> 00:07:52,882
Didn't take a walk on...

211
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:56,215
Columbus Avenue?

212
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:58,115
Well, I did go out
for a little while.

213
00:07:58,148 --> 00:08:00,915
Well, your day's getting
more interesting already.

214
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,326
Oh. See?

215
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:04,448
Oh. See?

216
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:06,148
Told me they'd be
back in a minute,

217
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:09,315
and <i>they</i> lied.

218
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:12,548
You can't trust anyone.

219
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:13,982
No, you can't.

220
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:16,048
Well, let's cut
the bull, sister!

221
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:18,182
You think I don't know
about you swappin' spit

222
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:20,182
with somebody yesterday
on Columbus Avenue?

223
00:08:20,215 --> 00:08:21,648
What are you talking about?

224
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:23,182
Look, my friend saw you.

225
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:24,682
Saw me? With who?

226
00:08:24,715 --> 00:08:26,648
You tell me.

227
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:29,315
There's nothing to tell.

228
00:08:30,648 --> 00:08:31,648
There isn't?

229
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:34,015
No.

230
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,515
Oh.

231
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:38,848
All right.

232
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:40,848
Wanna get some pizza?

233
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:47,115
I had a feeling this was
too good to be true. Why?

234
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:48,848
I knew there had to be
another side to you.

235
00:08:48,882 --> 00:08:50,048
No, no, there's no side.

236
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:52,515
There is a side, an ugly side.

237
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,882
No, no, no ugly side.

238
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:56,648
Look, I think
I'm gonna go.

239
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:57,682
Why?

240
00:08:57,715 --> 00:08:59,115
It's really hot in here.

241
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:01,782
Uh, so are we gonna still
go out on Friday, though?

242
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:04,326
Yeah. When are you gettin'
an air conditioner?

243
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:04,382
Yeah. When are you gettin'
an air conditioner?

244
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:05,382
I-it's comin'.

245
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:08,782
It's a Commando 8, 12,000 BTUs.

246
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,148
It's gonna be
like a meat locker in here.

247
00:09:13,715 --> 00:09:15,315
I was an idiot
for listening to you.

248
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:16,948
Hey, I saw
what I saw.

249
00:09:16,982 --> 00:09:18,715
Oh, everything was
going so well.

250
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:20,148
She hadn't seen
any flaws in me.

251
00:09:20,182 --> 00:09:21,315
Now she sees a side.

252
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:22,382
What side?

253
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:24,015
A bad side, an ugly side.

254
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:26,015
Oh, so what?
So what?

255
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:27,715
I wasn't planning
on showing that side

256
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:29,115
for another six months.

257
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:32,115
Now you made me throw off
the whole learning curve.

258
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:33,782
Why don't you
just ask Jeffrey?

259
00:09:33,815 --> 00:09:34,326
Oh, he'd just deny it.

260
00:09:34,326 --> 00:09:35,148
Oh, he'd just deny it.

261
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:37,448
There must be some way
to find out.

262
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:39,148
Amy said nothing happened.

263
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:40,848
You're gonna take
her word over mine?

264
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:42,015

00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,482
Yeah, but you're blind as a bat.

00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:46,482
I was squinting!

267
00:09:46,515 --> 00:09:48,248
Remember that drive
from Wurtsboro?

268
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:51,482
I was spottin'
those raccoons.

269
00:09:52,815 --> 00:09:54,515
They were mailboxes,
you idiot.

270

the heart to tell ya.

00:10:03,548 --> 00:10:04,326
A dime.

A dime.

Huh, Mercury head.
You mind?

275
00:10:13,048 --> 00:10:15,215
No, keep it.

276
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:23,548
What happened?
You buzzed 5 minutes ago.

277
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:25,382
There was a dog
in front of the building,

278
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:26,482
and it spooked me.

279
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:28,148
I couldn't come in
until he left.

280
00:10:28,182 --> 00:10:29,482
A little white dog?

281
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:31,015
Yeah.

You're afraid
of Snowball?

00:10:34,326 --> 00:10:36,115
You're afraid
of Snowball?

285
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:38,082
I'm afraid of dogs now.

286
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:41,748
He's like a squirrel.

287
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:44,582
Well, he frightened me.

288
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:47,648
Did you get the shot?

289
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:49,548
No. He said
I didn't need a shot.

290
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,048
You got bit
by a strange dog,

291
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:52,448
and you didn't get
a rabies shot?

292
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:53,615
Why, you think I should've?

293
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:54,882
Oh-ho!

294
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:56,548
You should go back
to the optical store

295
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:58,882
and ask Dwayne if he knows the
name of the owner of the dog.

296
00:10:58,915 --> 00:11:01,715
All right, that's a good idea.
I'm gonna do that.

297
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,315
Ah.

I went to see
your friend Dwayne,

there was no discount.

302
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:12,648
What?
That's right. No discount.

303
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:13,982
Well, did you
mention my name?

Look, I'm gonna go down there
with you right now. Come on.

309
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:26,815

He runs on batteries.

315
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:34,748
He runs on batteries.

316
00:11:36,648 --> 00:11:39,348
You know, George,
that's an onion.

317
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,648
Yes, it is.

318
00:11:52,648 --> 00:11:55,548
He couldn't tell
an apple from an onion,

319
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,982
and he's your eyewitness.

320
00:11:58,015 --> 00:12:01,315
I saw them makin' out.
You can believe it.

I don't know
what to believe.

You're eatin' onions,
you're spottin' dimes.

324
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:06,815
I don't know
what the hell is goin' on.

is get Amy and Jeffrey
together somewhere. That's it.

surprise Amy.

All I gotta do is
bring her with me.

opens the door,

it's Howdy Doody time.

334
00:12:24,982 --> 00:12:27,515
Mmm. Right this way, Mr. Doody.

What is goin' on here?

339

What are you talking about?

340
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:46,487
I'm talkin' about
the 30% discount.

341
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:48,387
Um, excuse me.
A man came in here--

Elaine,
don't interrupt.

343
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:51,187
They're discounting
something.

00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:53,254
Who said anything
about a discount?

345
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:56,421
Oh, how quickly we forget.

346
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:58,654
You owe me, buddy.
For what?

347
00:12:58,687 --> 00:13:00,187
Whoop! Remember this?

348
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:01,521
What are you doing?

349
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:03,628
Six months ago you were eating
four of those for breakfast

350
00:13:03,628 --> 00:13:04,021
Six months ago you were eating
four of those for breakfast

351
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:05,654
and chasing it
with a Ring Ding.

352
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:07,221
And two Butterfingers
on the train!

353
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,321
Sound familiar?!

354
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,754

00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:46,587
To the Paul Simon
"Concert in the Park."

531
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:48,554
We're going to
the Paul Simon concert?

532
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,754
That's right, lady.

533
00:19:49,787 --> 00:19:51,387
Ha-ha!
What a great surprise.

534
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:52,887
I thought
you'd like that.

535
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:56,154
Oh, so that's why you've been
acting so mysteriously.

536
00:19:56,187 --> 00:19:57,221
Now you know.

537
00:19:57,254 --> 00:19:59,887
That, and that alone,
is the reason.

538
00:20:01,554 --> 00:20:03,628
You know Jeffrey's
favorite animal?

539
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:03,887
You know Jeffrey's
favorite animal?

540
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:06,554
The leopard.

541
00:20:06,587 --> 00:20:07,721
Why is that?

542
00:20:07,754 --> 00:20:11,187
He likes the spots.

543
00:20:11,221 --> 00:20:13,021
Oh, uh, here's--
Here's the tickets.

544
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:14,821
Thank you.

545
00:20:14,854 --> 00:20:17,187
Oh, uh, he asked me
to give you a message.

546
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:20,021
He said that, uh,
he's very sorry,

547
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:22,521
and, uh, he hopes
you'll forgive him.

548
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,854
Ah-ha! So it's true.

549
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:27,654
You were makin' out
with him.

550
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:30,054
What are you talking about?
I don't know Jeffrey.

551
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:32,521
Oh, so this is why
you brought me up here.

552
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:33,628
Very convincing,

553
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:34,054
Very convincing,

554
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:35,687
but it's not gonna
work this time.

555
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:37,521
What are you
talking about?

556
00:20:37,554 --> 00:20:39,221
All he meant was
that he was sorry

557
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:41,587
that the seats
aren't very good.

558
00:20:44,054 --> 00:20:46,721
Oh.

559
00:20:46,754 --> 00:20:49,521
Oh.

560
00:20:49,554 --> 00:20:51,221
Wanna get
some pizza?

561
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:01,887
Boy, these really do
pinch the nose.

562
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:03,628
Tough luck.
A deal's a deal.

563
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:05,487
Tough luck.
A deal's a deal.

564
00:21:05,521 --> 00:21:07,021
Oh, my God. It is them.

565
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:17,687
[WHINNIES]

566
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,987
I still don't know how
you spotted that dime.

567
00:21:31,021 --> 00:21:32,021
I think you planted it.

568
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:33,628
Plus I got to pay that vet bill
for the stupid dog.

569
00:21:33,628 --> 00:21:35,687
Plus I got to pay that vet bill
for the stupid dog.

570
00:21:35,721 --> 00:21:37,621
I don't know how
that guy got my name.

571
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:41,154
Yeah. Heh.

572
00:21:41,187 --> 00:21:42,387
All right.

573
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:45,087
Boy, these really
do pinch.

574
00:21:45,121 --> 00:21:47,254
I tell you, if I ever find
the son of a bitch

575
00:21:47,287 --> 00:21:49,121
that stole my glasses...

576
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:02,254
But I want to know,
when did glasses

577
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,854
go from being this carefully
crafted medical apparatus

578
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:06,687
to just this mall impulse item?

579
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:08,321
"Honey, I'm going out
for a yogurt

580
00:22:08,354 --> 00:22:10,354
and a pair of trifocals.
You need anything?"

581
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:12,521
It's always glasses
in about an hour.

582
00:22:12,554 --> 00:22:13,721
"Well, how much are they?"

583
00:22:13,754 --> 00:22:14,987
"75 bucks."

584
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:16,754
"Well, here's 72.
It's about 75, okay?"

585
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:18,387
What, you tryin'
to coordinate it

586
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,421
with the one-hour photo place,
is that the idea?

587
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:21,921
"Hurry up. Gimme the glasses.

588
00:22:21,954 --> 00:22:25,521
My pictures are coming out
right now. I need to see 'em."

589
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:27,321
Then they have
those Woolworth glasses,

590
00:22:27,354 --> 00:22:28,521
you know, that are like,

591
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:29,318
they're there.
They're there now.

592
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:30,721
they're there.
They're there now.

593
00:22:30,754 --> 00:22:33,321
No eye exam, you don't have any
idea what's wrong with the eyes,

594
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:34,554
and the glasses are made up.

595
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,687
They are ready and waiting
for you to just walk in,

596
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:39,121
"Thank you. Bye." And just walk
right into a wall. Bang.
