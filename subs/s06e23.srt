00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,694
Monkeys are really the end
of the line in the pet world.

2
00:00:03,727 --> 00:00:06,094
I think when you're at the
monkey level of pet ownership,

3
00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:08,425
have a kid. I mean, come on.

4
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:10,459
I mean, you're so close.

5
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:14,759
If you need a pet that can
roller skate and smoke cigars,

6
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:16,592
it's time to think
about a family.

7
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:21,759
Monkeys, of course, were the
first astronauts in the '60s,

8
00:00:21,792 --> 00:00:24,592
which, I'm sure, made perfect
sense in the monkey brain.

9
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,425
"I feel that is the next
logical step for me

10
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:28,759
"because I've been workin'

11
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:30,000

and the crank organ,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,725
"with the Italian guy
and the crank organ,

13
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,292
and I think I'm ready to handle
the maximum reentry G-forces."

14
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:43,425
Take toilet paper,
for example.

15
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:45,959
Do you realize
that toilet paper

16
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:49,025
has not changed
in my lifetime?

17
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:51,259
It's just paper
on a cardboard roll.

18
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:52,592
That's it.

19
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,225
And in 10,000 years,

20
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,925
it will still be
exactly the same,

21
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:59,059
because, really,
what else can they do?

22
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,125
Yeah, that's true.

23
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,759
There really has been
no development in toilet paper.

24
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:06,059
And, I mean, everything else
has changed.

[CHUCKLES]

27
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:09,259
But toilet paper
is exactly the same,

28
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:11,625
and will be so
until we're dead.

29
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,925
Yeah, you're right,
George.

30
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,625
What else can they do?

31
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,059
It's just paper
on a roll, that's it,

32
00:01:19,092 --> 00:01:21,625
and that's all
it will ever be.

33
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,092
Wow.

00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,125

don't you?

00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,959
Yes.

Yes, I do.

He's the busboy. You think
he cares about the soup?

00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:52,259
Yeah, well, wouldn't he want
the soup to be good?

Yep, yep,

hasn't changed in my lifetime

and probably wouldn't change
for the next 50,000 years,

Hey, Alec.

354
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,359
Did you see that?

355
00:12:45,392 --> 00:12:46,625
What kind of a hello
was that?

356
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:51,359
MAN: Oh, Mr. Kramer.
KRAMER: Yes.

357
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:52,359
Thanks for coming.

358
00:12:52,392 --> 00:12:53,959
So, uh...

359
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:55,759
what did you wanna
see me about?

360
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:59,259
Well, Mr. Kramer,
to get right to it...

361
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,592
we're having a bit
of a problem with Barry.

362
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:05,292
Barry?

363
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:06,328
The chimpanzee.

364
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:06,625
The chimpanzee.

365
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,725
Oh. Well, uh...

366
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:10,059
what's the problem?

367
00:13:10,092 --> 00:13:13,625
Well, he's not functioning
the way he normally does.

368
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,059
He seems depressed.

369
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:17,092
He's lost his appetite.

370
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:21,259
He's even curtailed
his auto-erotic activities.

371
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:25,525
And we think this is
directly related

372
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,759
to the altercation he had
with you, the other day.

373
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:29,625
So? So, what do you
want me to do?

374
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:31,859
Well, frankly...

375
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:34,259
we'd like you to apologize.

376
00:13:35,392 --> 00:13:36,328
Yeah, well, he started it.

377
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:38,025
Yeah, well, he started it.

378
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,792
Mr. Kramer,
he's an innocent primate.

379
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:42,925
So am I!

380
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,292
What about my feelings?

381
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,959
Don't my feelings
count for anything?

Oh, only the poor
monkey's important.

Everything has to be done

Well, people never give
a good hello at a funeral.

399

I mean, they go like this.

That's the biggest.

401
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,559
Yeah, yeah, that's
kind of what he gave me.

do anything.

It's the monkey that should
be apologizing to me.

that's gonna happen.

the good word in for you

out of her left ear.
