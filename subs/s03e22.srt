00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:32,733
JERRY:
Okay, George,
come on.

527
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:34,333
Let's go.
I'm putting it in a garage.

528
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:35,566
The fight's starting
in two minutes.

529
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,066
It's enough already!
No, don't do it!

530
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,066
What are we gonna do?
Stay out here all night?

531
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,400
Yes, I'm not giving him
the satisfaction.

532
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:40,576
It's my space.

533
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:41,533
It's my space.

534
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:43,666
Why don't you just
flip a coin already?

535
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,666
No, no, no,
this is a matter of principle.

536
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,400
That would just be saying
that anybody can just

537
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,133
pull into any parking space
any way they want.

538
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,633
Well, I'm making a stand here.

539
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,333
I'm saying no
to headfirst parking!

540
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:53,633
I'm not putting up
with that.

541
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,633
We put up with too much crap
in this city!

542
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,400
We're not putting up
with headfirst parking!

543
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,166
You know, maybe if you hadn't
been sitting there

544
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,533
pontificating about
what a great parker you were,

545
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:03,200
you might've
got the space.

546
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,233
Oh, so you're
against me now?

547
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:06,966
Ohhh...
The man, he could've

548
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,166
pulled up to that car
and backed in,

549
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,566
but he chose
to go in headfirst.

550
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,866
No, he couldn't,

551
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,233
because the other car
was already backing in.

552
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,400
No, he wasn't.

553
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:17,866
All that matters is
who was there first.

554
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,733
Ah, you're not even old enough
to drive, you little puke.

555
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:22,300
You just spit on me!

556
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,300
Don't you raise
your voice to me!

557
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,233
You're not my father!

558
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:28,666
Hey, Matthew.

559
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,333
Hi, Jerry.

560
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:31,866
This guy's really
a jerk.

561
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,800
How you doing?

562
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,700
Okay.

563
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:36,566
Hey, how's your father?
I hear he's closing his store.

564
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,266
What?

565
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,900
Oh, no, nothing. Nothing.

566
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:40,576
What's happened to Daddy?
He's going out of business?

567
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:42,300
What's happened to Daddy?
He's going out of business?

568
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,000
No, no, no, no.

569
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:45,233
We're not going
to have any money?

570
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:46,233
No.
We're out of money?

571
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,066
No, of course not,
of course not.

572
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,400
Mommy!

573
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:51,533
Jerry says
Daddy's closing the store.

574
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:54,066
He's going
out of business.

575
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,633
We don't have
any money?

576
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,833
Jerry,
what's the matter with you?

577
00:17:57,866 --> 00:17:59,966
I didn't...

578
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,700
Boy, I don't know
about your friend, Jerry.

579
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,633
He says some pretty stupid
things sometimes.

580
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,833
Yeah.

581
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:06,066
[SIGHS]

582
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh,
congratulations.

583
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:09,466
What for?

584
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,576
Well,
you're pregnant.

585
00:18:10,576 --> 00:18:11,200
Well,
you're pregnant.

586
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:12,200
What?

587
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:13,700
You're not pregnant?

588
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:15,233
No, I'm not pregnant.

589
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:17,966
Are you sure
you're not pregnant?

590
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,500
Yes, I'm sure.

591
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:20,900
Whew.
That's weird.

592
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,900
Come on, Matthew.
No!

593
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:23,400
Come on, Matthew!

594
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:25,433
I thought she was pregnant.

595
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:27,666
Hey, do you think
I'm a phony?

596
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,400
What?
Mike thinks I'm a phony.

597
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:30,833
He thinks
you're a phony?

598
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:32,300
Yeah, but I can't
say anything,

599
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,666
because Kramer wasn't
supposed to tell me.

600
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,066
Oh, you have to
say something.

601
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,300
I can't. I told Kramer
I was vaulting it.

602
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,533
Well, you gotta
open the vault.

603
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:40,576
Open my vault?
Open your vault.

604
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:40,700
Open my vault?
Open your vault.

605
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:43,000
Once I open the vault,
it ceases to be a vault.

606
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:44,000
You have no choice.

607
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:46,733
Oy, the vault.

608
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:48,333
You wanna know why
you can't go in front-first?

609
00:18:48,366 --> 00:18:49,466
I'll tell you why.

610
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,000
Because it signals
a breakdown

611
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:52,233
in the social order.

612
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:53,533
Chaos!

613
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,000
It reduces us
to jungle law.

614
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,133
Well, when can you
park headfirst?

615
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,533
Never!

616
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:01,866
What're you asking
this guy for?

617
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,866
Who's talking to you?

618
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,966
He's right.
Never.

619
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,466
Oh, yeah?

620
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,233
Well, what if you got
10 car lengths?

621
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:09,733
Do you have to pull
all the way up to the front car?

622
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:10,576
Well, if you've got
10 car lengths...

623
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:11,800
Well, if you've got
10 car lengths...

624
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,533
When do you ever have
10 car lengths?

625
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:15,000
What about Sundays
and holidays, huh?

626
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:17,166
Oh, please...

627
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,133
Hey, what's
going on here?

628
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,000
Oh, uh, this guy
tried to sneak into my space.

629
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:23,666
Oh. I really hate
people who do that.

630
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,666
I hope you don't let him
get away with it.

631
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,366
Well, thank you
for your support.

632
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,666
Hey, that's a great hat.

633
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,400
Really? You like it?
Yeah.

634
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:35,333
I got it
at a flea market today.

635
00:19:35,366 --> 00:19:36,233
Hey, George,
nice hat.

636
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:37,233
Yeah, thanks.

637
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:38,533
Can I try it on?

638
00:19:38,566 --> 00:19:39,666
No, it, uh,
wouldn't fit you.

639
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,576
Oh, sure,
it would.

640
00:19:40,576 --> 00:19:40,666
Oh, sure,
it would.

641
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,900
No. Get out of here,
Newman.

642
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:43,166
Ah, let me try it.
Stop it!

643
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,400
Well, let him
try it on.

644
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,566
I don't want him to.

645
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,666
What is wrong with you?

646
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,000
You wanna see?!

647
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:50,366
There! There it is!

648
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,833
Run!

649
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,566
All right, here!
You wanna try on the hat?!

650
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,400
Here, try on the hat!
Stop it, George.

651
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:57,533
I was defending your parking.
Come on, George!

652
00:19:57,566 --> 00:19:59,733
All right, keep it,
just keep the hat!

653
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,233
All right, that's it,
the fight's already started.

654
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm going upstairs.
Who's coming? Elaine?

655
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:04,800
It depends on who's going.
Are you going?

656
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,566
I'm not going if he's going.
Me either.

657
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,066
And I'm not going
if he's going.

658
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,833
Well, I'm going.
If he's going, I'm not going.

659
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:10,576
But it's your house.
I still don't have to go.

660
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:11,566
But it's your house.
I still don't have to go.

661
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,333
I don't wanna go
if Jerry's not going.

662
00:20:13,366 --> 00:20:16,133
Why won't you go, if I go?
Why? I'll tell you why.

663
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,400
No, don't, Jerry.

664
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,533
Like, you didn't call me
a phony?!

665
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:20,966
What?

666
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,066
Thanks! Real good!

667
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,133
All right.

668
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,533
Jerry...

669
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:25,800
First of all,

670
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,466
I think you completely
misunderstood what I said.

671
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,333
I meant it
in a complimentary way.

672
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:31,700
I mean, you know
when people say, "He's bad,"

673
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:32,900
it really means,
"He's good"?

674
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:34,200
That sort of thing?

675
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,333
Uh, you know,
it's slang.

676
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:36,266
Use it in a sentence.

677
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:40,066
Man, that Michael Jordan
is so phony.

678
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:42,966
Why did you tell him?!

679
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,966
He begged me!

680
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,233
He begged you?!

681
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,200
All right, come on,
who wants to watch the fight?

682
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:51,233
Okay, whose cars are these?
Let's move them. Let's go.

683
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:52,633
Uh, o-o-officer,

684
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,800
could I just explain
something to you?

685
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,833
Let's go, or I'll write both
of you a ticket in two minutes.

686
00:20:57,866 --> 00:20:59,800
But, officer, he--
He can't pull in headfirst.

687
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,966
Officer, he backed up
from down the street.

688
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,666
He was double-parked.
He was sitting there.

689
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:06,833
All right,
you move your car.

690
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,433
It's his space.
You can't go in headfirst.

691
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,666
Wait a second.

692
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,400
Why can't
he go in headfirst?

693
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:17,666
He said the guy was
just sitting over there.

694
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,200
What are you
talking about?

695
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:20,666
This guy was
there first.

696
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,700
But he didn't
take it.

697
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:23,366
Hey,
it's his space,

698
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,000
No, it's his space.
What are you...?

699
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,500
MIKE:
You're gonna have to
leave eventually.

700
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:28,500
GEORGE:
Well, you're gonna have to
go to the bathroom!

701
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:30,233
MIKE:
Well, you're gonna have to
go to work!

702
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:32,233
GEORGE: I don't have a job!
MIKE: Neither do I!

00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:33,933
GEORGE: Yeah--

710
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:53,366
People will kill each other
for a parking space in New York,

711
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,366
because they think,
"If I don't get this one,

712
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,866
I may never get a space,"
you know?

713
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,633
"I'll be circling for months

714
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,066
until somebody goes out
to the Hamptons."

715
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,166
I think because everybody
in New York City

716
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,400
knows there's gotta be
way more cars

717
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:08,233
than parking spaces.

718
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:10,576
You see cars driving in New York
all hours of the night.

You see cars driving in New York
all hours of the night.

720
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:12,866
It's like musical chairs,

721
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,333

around 1964.

723
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,733
The problem is
car manufacturers are building

724
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:21,866
hundreds of thousands
of new cars every year.

725
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,666
They're not making
any new spaces.

726
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,166
That's what they should be
working on.

727
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,166
Wouldn't that be great?

728
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,533
You go to the auto show,

729
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:30,400
and they've got
that big revolving turntable,

730
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,400
and there's nothing on it.
