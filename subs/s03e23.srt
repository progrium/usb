00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,733
trading keys?

179
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:46,966
Because Elaine has my keys.

180
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,297
Well, you can get them back.

181
00:05:47,297 --> 00:05:48,166
Well, you can get them back.

182
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,300
I suppose I could.

183
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,466
Because you see,
George,

184
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,333
having the keys
to Jerry's apartment,

185
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:55,400
that kept me

186
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:57,266
in a fantasy world.

187
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,166
Every time
I went over to his house,

188
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,966
it was like I was on vacation--

189
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,166
better food, better view,
better TV...

190
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,833
cleaner, oh-ho,
much cleaner.

191
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,366
That became
my reality.

192
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,533
I ignored the squalor
in my own life,

193
00:06:12,566 --> 00:06:14,466
because I'm looking
at life, you see,

194
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,433
through Jerry's eyes.

195
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:17,297
I was living
in twilight, George,

196
00:06:17,297 --> 00:06:18,500
I was living
in twilight, George,

197
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:22,166
living in the shadows,
living in the darkness...

198
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,666
like you.

199
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,166
Me?

200
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,466
Oh, yeah.

201
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,266
I can barely see you,
George.

202
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,733
All right, stop it, Kramer.
You're freaking me out.

203
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,400
Hi. Are you ready to order?

204
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:39,666
Yeah, what's the--?
No, no, not yet, not yet.

205
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,800
E-excuse me.
Get out.

206
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,933
Oh.

207
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:47,297
Do you ever yearn?

208
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:48,100
Do you ever yearn?

209
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,933

210
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:53,800
I yearn.

211
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,066
You yearn?
Oh, yes.

212
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,300
Yes, I yearn.

213
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,333
Often, I...

214
00:06:57,366 --> 00:07:00,800
I sit and yearn.

215
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,200
Have you yearned?

216
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,400
Well, not recently.

217
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:09,800
I craved.

218
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,666
I crave all the time,
constant craving,

219
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,166
but I haven't yearned.

220
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,297
Look at you.

221
00:07:17,297 --> 00:07:17,966
Look at you.

222
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,633
Oh, Kramer, don't start.

223
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:20,633
No, no.

224
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:21,700
No, you're wasting your life.

225
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:22,733
I am not.

226
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:24,900
What you call "wasting,"
I call "living."

227
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:26,466
I'm living my life.

228
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,233
Yeah, okay, like what?
No, tell me.

229
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:29,300
Do you have a job?

230
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,300
No.

231
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,733
You got money?

232
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:33,200
No.

233
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:35,200
Do you have a woman?

234
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,566
No.

235
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,100
Do you have any prospects?

236
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,233
No.

237
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:43,733
You got anything on the horizon?

238
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,297
Uh...

239
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:47,333
Uh...

240
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,133
no.

241
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,000
Do you have any action at all?

242
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:52,966
No.

243
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,733
Do you have
any conceivable reason

244
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,666
for even getting up
in the morning?

245
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,066
I like to get the <i>Daily News.</i>

246
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:05,233
George, it's time
for us to grow up

247
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:06,666
and be men,

248
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,700
not little boys.
Why?

249
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm going to California.
You know, I've got the bug.

250
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,400
Yeah, I think I've got a touch
of something too.

251
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:14,733
No, the acting bug,

252
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:16,533

in that Woody Allen movie.

00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,166
That was one line.
You got fired.

256
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,833
I know, I know,
but, man, I never felt so alive.

257
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:26,900
Now, you coming with me?

258
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:28,666
Uh, no, I'm not.

259
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,800
All right,
suit yourself.

260
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,466
But let's keep this
between us.

261
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,033
We're key brothers now.

262

You're not
really gonna go

263
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:38,466
to California,
are you?

264
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,700
Up here,
I'm already gone.

265
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:49,066
Anyway, so he gave me
his spare keys,

266
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,666
and now he wants
to have my keys,

267
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,166
so I need mine
back from you.

268
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,500
Just because
you have his keys?

269
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,566
Why does he need yours?

270
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,666
I don't know.

271
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,800
He said he wants
to be my key brother.

272
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:58,800
That's ridiculous.

273
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,800
That's Kramer.

274
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,233
I'll give you back
your spare keys,

275
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:04,800
but now I want mine back.

276
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,300
What for?

277
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,200
Because I'll give them to Jerry.

278
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:09,700
Jerry? Why?

279
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:10,733
Because he gave me his.

280
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:12,333
So what?

281
00:09:12,366 --> 00:09:16,633
So if he has my keys,
I should have his.

282
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,297
I don't see why if you have his,
he should have yours.

00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't see why if you have his,
he should have yours.

have them with me.

to give back to Kramer?

Yeah, okay, I'll go get them.

Would you just put that down?

Did you bring
the keys?

294
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,700
Yes, but I still
don't feel right

295
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:44,900
about letting you
into Kramer's apartment

296
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:45,900
without his permission.

297
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,166
This could be an emergency.

298
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,297
You shouldn't have
taken away his keys.

Yeah, coy.

You want to know
what happened to Kramer?

I'll tell you what
happened to Kramer.

335
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,000
He was ticked off
about the keys.

336
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,366
Yeah, that's right,
about the keys.

337
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:46,166
He thought
he got a bad rap.

338
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,166
Bad rap?

339
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,297
Yeah, from you.

00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:48,200

00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:24,893
They look exactly like keys.

536
00:18:24,893 --> 00:18:27,133
They look exactly like keys.

537
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:30,033
"What do they look like?"

538
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:31,666
Well, they're
obviously not here.

539
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,333
Well, they've got
to be here somewhere.

540
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:36,400
Jerry, unless I pull down
on this statuette

541
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:38,666
and a hidden wall opens up,

542
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,100
we've checked every square inch
of this apartment.

543
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:44,766
What is this?

544
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,066
<i>Murphy Brown?</i>

545
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,133
What?

546
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,033
"By Elaine Benes"?
What?

547
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:54,533
Elaine's writing a <i>Murphy Brown?</i>

548
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:54,893
Let me see this.

549
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:56,133
Let me see this.

550
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,133
Wait a second.

551
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,333
Let me just
look at it.

552
00:18:58,366 --> 00:18:59,500
Let me just
look at it.

553
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:00,533
Give me half.

554
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:01,900
All right, here.

555
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,200
Why didn't she tell us?

556
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:09,866
Elaine is writing
a sitcom?

557
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,533
You-- you-- you weasels!

558
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:18,533
What? What?

559
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:20,333
How dare you?

560
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,066
We hardly read anything.
It was funny.

561
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,900
Who gave you permission
to come into my house

562
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:24,893
and just go through
all my things?

563
00:19:24,893 --> 00:19:25,633
and just go through
all my things?

564
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,666
You thought it was funny?

565
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,033
Well, you know...

566
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:30,333
from what I saw...

567
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:31,866
Well, it's just a first draft!

568
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,300
I was locked
out of my apartment.

569
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,700
I'm just trying
to get my keys.

570
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:36,366
Why did you let him in?

571
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,366
He forced me to.

572
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,866
I did not!
Yes, you did!

573
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,700
You, get out! Get out, get out!

574
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:41,800
Wait, wait!
Get out!

575
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,033
I need my spare keys.

576
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:44,333
Oh, here, here's
your damn keys.

577
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:45,466
You keep them.

578
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,666
I don't want them
anymore.
Good.

579
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,000
And I want my keys back.

580
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:49,566
You don't want me
to hold your keys?

581
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,666
No, you can't be trusted.

582
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,000
All right, all right, fine.

583
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:54,566
And I don't want you
to hold mine.

584
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:54,893
Good. I won't.

585
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:55,833
Good. I won't.

586
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:57,666
Good. Don't.

587
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,733
Are these my keys?

588
00:19:58,766 --> 00:19:59,800
These aren't my keys.

589
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:00,833
Whose are these?

590
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,666
I don't know.

591
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,600
["CALIFORNIA GIRLS"
BY THE <i>BEACH BOYS</i> PLAYING]

592
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,533
I just thought I could write it.

593
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:19,666
Is that something
you want to do?

594
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,633
I don't know.

595
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,000
Those writers
make a lot of money.

596
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,133
What?

597
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,300
Elaine,
let me tell you something

598
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,466
about show business.

599
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,033
Ugh...

600
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:33,166
I can't believe it.

601
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,633
It's hard work.

602
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,800
You don't just write
a <i>Murphy Brown.</i>

603
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:37,966
You've gotta
watch the show,

604
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,666
study it, get a sense
of the characters,

605
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,133
how they relate
to each other...

606
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,100
Okay, can I just
watch the show?

607
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,666
Oh, God,
what an ass...

608
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:54,893
What did you say?

609
00:20:54,893 --> 00:20:55,100
What did you say?

610
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,900
I didn't say anything.

611
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,333
I heard something.

612
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,866
Elaine, Elaine,
it's Kramer!

613
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,700
Kramer's on <i>Murphy Brown!</i>

614
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,733
Kramer's on <i>Murphy Brown?</i>

615
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:12,733
Look, there he is.

616
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:13,700
He's sitting
at the desk!

617
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:17,066
<i>Hi. I'm Murphy Brown.</i>

618
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,400
<i>You must be</i>
<i>my new secretary.</i>

619
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:20,400
<i>Oh, good morning,</i>
<i>Miss Brown.</i>

620
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:21,466
<i>And you are?</i>

621
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,800
<i>Uh, I'm... Steven Snell.</i>

622
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:24,893
<i>Snell...</i>

623
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:25,500
<i>Snell...</i>

624
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,133
<i>Well, hello,</i>
<i>Mr. Snell.</i>

625
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,400
<i>Steven.</i>

626
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:30,033
<i>Steven.</i>

627
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:32,400
<i>Are you familiar with</i>
<i>this computer system?</i>

628
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:35,700
<i>Oh... I'm familiar, yes.</i>

629
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:38,666
<i>Steven Snell,</i>
<i>I know people,</i>

630
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,233
<i>and I have</i>
<i>a very good feeling</i>

631
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,466
<i>about you.</i>

632
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,066
<i>Yes.</i>

633
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,500
So I fly a lot. I like planes.

634
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:54,893
I was on a plane the other day,

635
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:56,133
I was on a plane the other day,

636
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,133
and I was wondering,
"Are there keys to the plane?

637
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,666
Do they need keys
to start the plane?"

638
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,833
Maybe that's what
those delays on the ground are,

639
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,033
when you're sitting
at the gate.

640
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:06,533
Maybe the pilot's going,

641
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:09,033
"Oh, I don't believe this.

642
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,300
"Oh, my God.

643
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,133
I did it again."

644
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,200
They tell you
it's something mechanical,

645
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,233
because they don't want
to come on the PA system--

646
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:18,466
"Ladies and gentlemen,

647
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,466
"we're gonna be delayed
for a little while.

648
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
"Oh, God,
this is so embarrassing.

649
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:24,700
"I...

650
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:24,893
I left the keys to the plane
in my apartment."

651
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:26,666
I left the keys to the plane
in my apartment."

652
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,166
You see the technicians

653
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,466
all running
underneath the plane.

654
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,966
You think they're servicing it,

655
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,833
but they're actually looking
for, like, the magnet hide-a-key

656
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:34,000
under the wing.

657
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:36,400
"Maybe he left it
up there somewhere."

658
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,533
