The big new accessory
with eyeglasses

2
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:05,571
seems to be that strap
that connects in the back

3
00:00:05,604 --> 00:00:07,004
so you can take 'em on and off.

4
00:00:07,038 --> 00:00:09,571
Which I don't get, because
I thought if you have glasses,

5
00:00:09,604 --> 00:00:13,571
isn't that because
you need to wear glasses?

6
00:00:13,604 --> 00:00:14,971
You need glasses.

7
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:16,138
Isn't that what they say?

8
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:17,604
I mean, an eye doctor
doesn't say,

9
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:19,871
"Would you care
for some glasses?"

10
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,071
When people have crutches,

11
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:25,771
they don't have like a little
chain attached to their belt,

12
00:00:25,804 --> 00:00:28,104
so they can just let go of them
every now and then.

13
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:30,000
Why not get a toupee
with a rubber band

14

Oh, busy.
Don't give me busy.

All right, tell me,
what's kept you so busy?

So you called the cop a pig?

00:01:19,089 --> 00:01:21,156
I was yelling
at the litterbug.

I mean,
this is my town.

You don't throw trash
on the streets of my town.

00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:28,156
So didn't you explain
that to the cop?

36
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,589
No, I fled the scene.

He told me
a few months ago.

and not me?

Huh. Really? How bad?
Was he on his deathbed?

No, he was on
his regular bed.

So why didn't you tell me?

67

should've told me.

better off not knowing.

Well, I want to talk
to him about this!

She's not your wife!

you would've given it away.

Where'd he get those?

Why? You don't
wear glasses.

I know, but I need a new look.
I'm stagnating.

as a glasses-wearer,

to that.

in touch with this guy?

let me tell you a story.

144
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:05,202
In 1979, I ticketed
a brown Dodge Diplomat

145
00:05:05,202 --> 00:05:07,989
In 1979, I ticketed
a brown Dodge Diplomat

146
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:09,656
for parking
in a church zone.

147
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,889
That fine
was never paid.

148
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:13,189
And since then,
that scofflaw

149
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:14,889
has piled up
more parking tickets

150
00:05:14,922 --> 00:05:17,056
than anyone
in New York City.

151
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:19,522
For 16 years,
I pursued him,

152
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:21,222
only to see him
give me the slip

153

154
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,556
I've never got
a clean look at his face,

155
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:28,722
but he's become
my white whale.

156
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:32,222
Mr. Kramer,
that day was yesterday!

157
00:05:32,256 --> 00:05:33,656
But thanks to you,

158
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:35,202
I don't know if I'll ever
get that chance again.

159
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,556
I don't know if I'll ever
get that chance again.

160
00:05:37,322 --> 00:05:39,056
I like that eye patch.

161
00:05:41,756 --> 00:05:43,389
All right.
I'm gonna move my car.

162
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:44,856
My meter's up.

listen,

company I work for?

They own that parking lot
around the corner.

167
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:53,689
That's a Kinney lot?

168
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:56,856
Yeah. And there's
a space opening up, and...

169
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,122
I-I could get it for you.

170
00:05:58,156 --> 00:05:59,622
You'd just have to
pay the tax on it.

171
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:00,789
It'd be, like, 50 a month.

172
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:03,356
Fifty bucks a month?
That's incredible.

173
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:04,856
Okay! Thanks!

00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:05,202
All right, I got lunch,
all right?

175
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:06,489
All right, I got lunch,
all right?

176

All right, listen.

There is something I haven't
told you, all right. Yeah?

179
00:06:15,556 --> 00:06:17,189
Yeah, but you can't tell Jerry.

180
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:19,356
What do you think,
I tell Jerry everything?

181
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:21,122
It's not like
he's my wife.

Okay, well...

00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:27,022
The thing is,
I've been livin' a lie.

185
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:28,189

ELAINE:
So he refused

196
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:45,189
to tell you where
he got the glasses?

197
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:46,322
Flat out refused.

00:06:46,356 --> 00:06:49,056
Yeah, isn't that
just like him?

You know, he has to be
the only one who has them.

Yeah, tell me about it,
soul sister.

201
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:56,222
Anyway, I told Jake
that you said hi.

What?!

203

You told Jake
I said hi?

00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:01,522
Yeah.

I can't believe you did that.
Why did you tell him I said hi?

206
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:05,202
I never said hi.

207
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:05,222
I never said hi.

208
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:06,522
When did I say hi?

209
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:07,722
I never heard her say hi.

210
00:07:07,756 --> 00:07:09,322
Well, it's
common courtesy.

211
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:11,556
No! No, Kramer,
you don't understand.

212
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:13,322
He made the last
contact between us.

213
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:17,522
I had the upper hand in
the post break-up relationship.

214
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:21,356
If he thinks that I said hi,
then I lose the upper hand.

215
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:22,489
It's like a game of tag.

216
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:24,156
Where you goin'?

00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:25,656
Nowhere.

You're going to the bookstore
to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?

00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,622
So, what if I do?

220
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:30,989
Listen, if you're
going there,

221
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:33,456
maybe you can get him to tell
you where he got those glasses.

How'd it go
with Gary?

Fine.

00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:41,089

Yup.

on your mind.

No, nothing.

I'm fine.

That is not it.

So you see,

00:08:41,656 --> 00:08:44,556
Kramer took it upon himself
to say hi to you from me

257
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:47,222
when, in fact,
it was an unauthorized hi.

258
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:48,489
You didn't say hi.

259
00:08:48,522 --> 00:08:49,522
That's what I'm saying.

260
00:08:49,556 --> 00:08:50,889
That's what you
came to tell me.

261
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:51,889
Correct.

262
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:53,489
You never said hi.
Correct.

263
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:54,856
You still like me,
don't you?

264
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:56,289
Correct-- What's that?

265
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:58,622
Hey, I have been trying to get
this book signed all day.

266
00:08:58,656 --> 00:08:59,722
How can you say

267
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:00,856
that I still love you

268
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:02,789
when I didn't even
say hi to you?

269
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:05,202
Elaine, coming down here to say
that you didn't say hi

270
00:09:05,202 --> 00:09:05,222
Elaine, coming down here to say
that you didn't say hi

271
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:07,356
is more of a gesture
than if you did say hi.

Uh, er...

The doctors thought
he had cancer,

276
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:16,489
but the surgery revealed
he never actually had it.

277
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:17,822
So, what was wrong
with him?

278
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:18,889
Nothing.

person is this?

who might be able to do this,

and that's you.

00:09:27,156 --> 00:09:28,489
Well...

00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:29,956
I don't even think
you could do it.

286
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:31,956
I could do it.

00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:32,956

Pfft. Come on.

00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:37,822
Did you know he was so worried
about losing more hair

291
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:39,322
if he had to get
chemo treatments,

292
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,522
I bought him
an unlimited gift certificate

00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:44,656
at the Hair Team For Men,
just to put his mind at ease?

294
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:46,356
You did that?
Yeah.

295
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:47,989
Oh, I can't wait
to talk to this guy.

296
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:50,289
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
You can't say anything!

00:09:50,322 --> 00:09:51,322
Why not?

298
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:52,656
Because he'll know
I told you.

299
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:54,689
He's giving me a parking spot
around the corner

300
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:56,156
for practically nothing.

301
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:58,622
You're telling me, because
you're getting free parking,

302
00:09:58,656 --> 00:10:00,789
I gotta pretend this guy
had cancer when he didn't?

Yeah.

304
00:10:03,156 --> 00:10:05,189
Well, I don't like it.

I don't like it one bit.

I'm supposed
to see him tomorrow.

307
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:10,189
Well, you have to maintain
the same disposition too.

00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:11,822

differently.

You have to be nice.

Why didn't he tell me?

311
00:10:13,856 --> 00:10:15,122
Because you were
being so nice.

312
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,489
I don't think
I can be that nice.
