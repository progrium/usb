1
00:00:00,966 --> 00:00:03,666
What is with the age-gap
hiring policy

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,733
at most movie theaters?

3
00:00:04,766 --> 00:00:06,133
You ever notice
they never hire anyone

4
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:08,333
between the ages of 15 and 80?

5
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:09,566
You know what I mean?

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,366
The girl that sells you
the ticket, she's 10.

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,633
Then there's the guy
that rips it, he's 102.

8
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:15,833
What happened
in the middle there?

9
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:16,833
Couldn't find anybody?

10
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,233
It's like they want to show you

11
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:20,300
how life comes full circle.

12
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,300
You know, you're 15.

13
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,366
You're selling the tickets.

14
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,566
Then you leave, you go out,

15
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,800
you have a family,
kids, marriage,

16
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,066
career, grandchildren...

17
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,300
Eighty years later,

18
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,200
you're back at the same theater,
three feet away,

19
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:30,000
ripping tickets.

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,533
ripping tickets.

21
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:32,733
It took you 80 years
to move three feet.

22
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,800
I don't understand.
The show's delayed? Why?

23
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,200
I don't know. Diane told me
to hold it for 15 minutes.

24
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:44,800
You don't understand.
I got this all timed.

25
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,366
I got another spot
cross-town at 9:50.

26
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,800
I'm not gonna make it.
I hear you, guy.

27
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:49,900
And I'm doing <i>Letterman</i> Monday.

28
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,533
You know, I gotta work out
the material.

29
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:53,500
Let me see what I can do.

30
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:58,066
JERRY:
Oh, no. Buckles?

31
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,700
You're not putting him
on tonight, are you?

32
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:02,833
No. He hangs around
in case somebody drops out.

33
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:04,451
Look, why don't you come back
and do the 11:00 spot?

34
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:05,866
Look, why don't you come back
and do the 11:00 spot?

35
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,233
I'm supposed to meet my friends

36
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:10,333
to see this movie <i>Checkmate</i>
at 10:30.

37
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:11,366
All right, forget the movie.

38
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,566
I'll do the 11:00 spot.

39
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,333
I'll be back.

40
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,333
Hey, Jer!

41
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,933
Hey!

42
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:25,866
Excuse me,
do you have a ticket?

43
00:01:27,266 --> 00:01:28,233
No.

44
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:30,366
Okay, good.

45
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:33,666
You missed
your spot.

46
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,451
It was 9:15.

47
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:34,900
It was 9:15.

48
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:37,533
But, Maurice,
I'm positive you told me 9:50.

49
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:38,900
In any event,

50
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,500
I had no alternative
but to reassign your spot

51
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:42,800
to one of your peers

52
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:43,900
who possesses

53
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:45,633
a clearer understanding

54
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,000
of our scheduling
policies.

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,166
Jerry!

56
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,466
What are you doing here?

57
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,866
Hey, do you think
this is funny?

58
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,466
Why do they call it
athlete's foot?

59
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,566
You don't have to be an athlete
to get it.

60
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,700
I mean, my father gets it
all the time,

61
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:03,966
and, believe me,
he's no athlete.

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,451
I gotta go.
Where?

63
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:05,300
I gotta go.
Where?

64
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,300
The movies.
Well, I thought you told Curtis

65
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,133
you were going back
to do the 11:00.

66
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,133
I am. I'm just gonna
stop by the theater

67
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,700
and tell my friends
I can't make it.

68
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,500
Well, that's cool.
I'll split a cab with you.

69
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:15,500
I could be a while.

70
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:16,900
I got time.

71
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:19,133
It'll give us a chance
to get to know each other

72
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,066
a little better.

73
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,133
Hey!
Hey!

74
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,166
[LAUGHS]

75
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,166
Where is everybody?

76
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,533
Everybody's late...

77
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,733
because they know good old
George would get in line early.

78
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:34,451
Oh, I've been dying
to see <i>Checkmate.</i>

79
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:34,800
Oh, I've been dying
to see <i>Checkmate.</i>

80
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,533
If it's as good
as <i>Ponce de León,</i>

81
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:37,533
I'll be happy.

82
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:39,066
<i>Ponce de León?</i>

83
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,300
Are you kidding me?

84
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,733
I hated that movie.

85
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:43,466
<i>Ponce de León?</i>

86
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,533
But that was great.

87
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:46,066
Oh, come on.

88
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,566
That fountain
of youth scene

89
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,900
at the end,

90
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:50,200
where they're all
splashing around,

91
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:52,000
and then they go running
over to the mirror

92
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,300
to see if
it really worked...

93
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,366
[LAUGHING]
I mean, come on.

94
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,700
It's so stupid.

95
00:02:57,733 --> 00:02:59,200
Let me tell you something.

96
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:01,666
When Ponce looked in that mirror

97
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,200
and saw that he hadn't changed,

98
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:04,451
and that tear started
to roll down his cheek,

99
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,566
and that tear started
to roll down his cheek,

100
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,900
I lost it.

101
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,033
Oh, there you are.

102
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:09,400
Oh, where have you been?
Hi.

103
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:11,166
Around the corner
at the Paradise Twin.

104
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,866
Well, I told you the Paragon.

105
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,333
No, you said
"Paradise."

106
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:16,333
I mean, it's playing
there too, you know.

107
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:17,900
No, I would not have said
"Paradise."

108
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:20,533
That's a twin theater. I want
to see it on a big screen.

109
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:22,533
Listen, I'm gonna get
a hot dog at Papaya King.

110
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:23,633
No!
No, wait!

111
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,200
You're never gonna
make it back in time.

112
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:26,400
I'm starving.
I haven't had dinner.

113
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:27,833
Get a hot dog
at the theater.

114
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:29,200
I don't want
a movie hot dog.

115
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:30,633
I want a Papaya King
hot dog.

116
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,866
Kramer, Jerry's gonna be here
any second,

117
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,366
and then this line's
gonna start moving,

118
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,451
and we're gonna end up
in the front row.

119
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:36,166
and we're gonna end up
in the front row.

120
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,366
Well, just
save me a seat.

121
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,833
No, I don't wanna save seats.

122
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:39,966
Don't put me through that.

123
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,233
I once had the fleece

124
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,900
just ripped out
of my winter coat

125
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,166
in a seat-saving incident.

126
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,733
All right, well,
give me my ticket, then.

127
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:47,200
I don't have them yet.

128
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,333
What do you mean,
you don't have them yet?

129
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:51,133
I'm in line to buy.

130
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,666
No, George,

131
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,066
this is a ticket holders' line.

132
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,500
No, it's not.
It's the ticket buyers' line.

133
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:57,700
Then how come we're not moving?

134
00:03:57,733 --> 00:03:59,000
Good question.

135
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:03,200
Is this the ticket holders' line
or the buyers'?

136
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:04,451
Holders.

137
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:04,466
Holders.

138
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,033
When I asked you before
if you had a ticket,

139
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:08,166
you said no.

140
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,500
I didn't.

141
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,133
My friend was getting it.

142
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,166
That's good.
It's good to be accurate.

143
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,000
All right, stay here.
I'll go get tickets.

144
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:17,200
Can you believe him?

145
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:18,200
He's spaced out.

146
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
How long would you
have stood

147
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,166
in the ticket
holders' line?

148
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,333
Yeah, exactly.

149
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:26,833
It's sold out.

150
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,166
Oh, real good, George.

151
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,133
Real good.

152
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,133
Hey, I asked the guy
if he had a ticket!

153
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,800
All right,
what time is it?

154
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,451
Twenty after 10.

155
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:34,800
Twenty after 10.

156
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:35,800
All right,
they got one

157
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,133
at the Paradise
at 10:45.

158
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,833
No, I don't wanna go
to a miniplex multi-theater.

159
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:41,966
It's the same movie.

160
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,966
What's
the difference?

161
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,366
No, it's not a theater.

162
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,966
It's like a room
where they bring in POWs

163
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,200
to show them propaganda films.

164
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:51,466
All right. I'm going.

165
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,066
It's in Dolby.

166
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,966
Well, what about Jerry?

167
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,166
You guys go
get the tickets.

168
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,166
I'll wait here
for him.

169
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,566
Terrific. All right.
All right.

170
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,733
Come on.
Come on.

171
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,133
BUCKLES:
So, then, when I was 12,

172
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,900
the whole family moved
from Bensonhurst

173
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:12,700
to Sheepshead Bay.

174
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:13,866
Mm-hmm.

175
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,366
We were right on the water.

176
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,166
The whole atmosphere
stunk from fish.

177
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,300
You know that fishy smell
I'm talking about?

178
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,400
Yeah, yeah, the fishy smell.

179
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:25,233
To this day, I won't eat fish.

180
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:26,233
Do you eat fish?

181
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:28,900
Yes! Yes, I eat fish.

182
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,733
I don't know
how you can eat that crap.

183
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:31,733
Take the park.

184
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,466
No, no, no, take 55th.

No, there's

No, there's
beautiful homes there.

187
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,066
There's lovely, talented,
attractive people.

188
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,400
You'll thank me.

189
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:42,000
Jerry, I want you
to do me a favor.

190
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:43,400
No more fish.

191
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:45,733
Okay, I get your point!

192
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:47,100
I have a point?

193
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:51,800
Got 'em.

194
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,033
Beautiful.

195
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,033
Hey, you know

196
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:55,133
what else
is playing here?

197
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,233

Ugh!

199
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:58,366
I wouldn't mind
seeing that.

200
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,033
Yeah...you know,

201
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:01,733
the most pointless,
boring movie

202
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:03,566
if there's even
the slightest possibility

203
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,451
that a woman
will take her top off.

204
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:05,333
that a woman
will take her top off.

205
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:08,166
So, what's your point?

206
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,166
[CHUCKLES]

207
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,166
Oh, by the way,
you owe me 7.50.

208
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, all right.
Can you break a 20?

209
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:14,500
No, I don't have any change.

210
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:16,666
Oh, well, then,
I'll pay you later.

211
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,633
Or I could take the 20,
and I could pay you later.

212
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,500
Yeah, you could.

213
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:23,400
Might be easier.

214
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:25,066
Well, how's that easier?

215
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,866
I mean, then you'd owe me 12.50
instead of me owing you 7.50.

216
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,700
Either way.

217
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,733
Yeah, it's the same thing.

218
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:37,666
So...can I have it?

219
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,500
I tell you what,

220
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,666
I'll get the popcorn
and the soda.

221
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,866
What do you mean,

222
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,300
you'll "get" the popcorn
and the soda?

223
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,466
I will buy your popcorn
and soda,

224
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,633
and we'll call it even.

225
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,200
I'll tell you what,
give me the 20.

I'll buy you a popcorn
and a soda,

227
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:53,000
and I'll throw in the bonbons.

228
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:55,566
George, you're sapping
my strength.

Hey, come on, go!

230
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:59,233
What about Kramer

00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:00,466
I'll wait out here
for them.

232
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,700
You go in
and save seats.

233
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:03,166
Me? But that's three seats.

234
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,451
I can't save three seats.

235
00:07:04,451 --> 00:07:04,700
I can't save three seats.

who tore up my winter coat.

Go save them. Go.

00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,700
Saturday night
theater traffic.

00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:20,833
Good move.

242
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:24,033
I wonder how Ike Turner
would react in traffic.

fo' I bust you up...

00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,366

this piece of material.

That's very nice of you.

start up with me.

No, I'm not riffing.

so they can come in, okay?

so they can come in, okay?

and I could save the seats?

you didn't like saving anyway.

is packed to the gills.

in the world.

in my closet.

you get in, that's all.

Hey, did that guy
show up?

351
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:17,733
The guy with the horse face
and the big teeth?

352
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:20,333
No, with the big head
and the flared nostrils.

353
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:21,766
Haven't seen him.

354
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,666
There was a short guy
with glasses.

355
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,000
Looked like Humpty Dumpty
with a melon head,

356
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:31,400
but he left.

357
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:33,033
Hmm.

358
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:34,451
So I got home,
and he was vacuuming.

359
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:36,033
So I got home,
and he was vacuuming.

360
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,533
I mean, he's 12 years old.

361
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:40,533
Who else but my Alan
would do something like that?

362
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:44,533
And then, last night,
he put on my high heels.

363
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:47,033
Oh, he put on such a show
for us.

364
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:50,166
He was dancing around,
lip-synching to <i>A Chorus Line.</i>

365
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,733
I mean,
you can see he's got talent.

366
00:11:51,766 --> 00:11:53,200
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

367
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:55,700
What's the problem?

368
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:56,700
You're talking.

369
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:59,033
It's the coming attractions.

370
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:01,633
So, anyway, he sings,
he dances,

371
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,451
and you know what
he's gotten into now?

372
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:04,566
and you know what
he's gotten into now?

373
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,700
He is cooking.
He does a crepe...

375
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:13,400
Uh, I just went out. I went
to look for my friends.

378
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,166
Mm-hmm.

380
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:21,866
No one holds onto the stub.
