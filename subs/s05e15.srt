1
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:03,140
Aren't mannequins an insult
to your imagination?

2
00:00:03,173 --> 00:00:06,040
"You couldn't possibly
visualize a sweater,

3
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,406
so we'll show you on this
life-size, snotty puppet."

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,240
I guess when
they're finished with them,

5
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:11,706
they become
crash-test dummies.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,506
That's the end of the line
for a mannequin.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,806
"Whatever happened to Bob?"

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,840
"Have you seen
that new Volvo commercial?

9
00:00:17,873 --> 00:00:20,873
He's got a bull's-eye
right in his face."

10
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:23,706
Mannequins are only used
for car accidents and fashion.

11
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,540
I guess these are
the two situations

12
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:27,740
that it's impossible for us
to imagine ourselves:

13
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:30,000
well-dressed
or getting killed.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,040
well-dressed
or getting killed.

15
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:32,173
I'm sure some
pro-mannequin organization,

16
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:34,206
doesn't even like you
to use the term mannequin.

17
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,706
"Hey, they're not mannequins.

18
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,740
They're the life-deprived."

19
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:44,601
AUDREY:
Mmm, that was really good.

20
00:00:44,634 --> 00:00:46,367
Yeah.
Are you full?

21
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:48,567
Oh, no.
I've had just enough.

22
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:51,401
Ah, here we go.
Apple pie.

23
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:54,434
Best apple pie
in the city.

24
00:00:57,634 --> 00:00:59,101
Mmm.

25
00:00:59,134 --> 00:01:00,701
Delicious.

26
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:02,201
I'm not waiting
for you.

27
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:05,567
Take some.

28
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:06,567
No, thanks.

29
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:07,834
You're not gonna
have any?

30
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:08,834
No.

31
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:09,790
Do you not like
apple pie?

32
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,234
Do you not like
apple pie?

33
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:12,534
No. It's not that.

34
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:13,901
Well,
at least taste it.

35
00:01:13,934 --> 00:01:15,301
No.

36
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:18,567
You won't even
taste it?

37
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:20,234
No.

38
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:22,201
Come on,
try it.

39
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:25,234
A little taste.

40
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:27,734
Come on.

41
00:01:32,434 --> 00:01:34,034
She wouldn't
so much as taste it.

42
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:36,034
She say why?

43
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:37,401
No. She wouldn't
say anything.

44
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:39,790
She just kept
shaking her head like this:

45
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,201
She just kept
shaking her head like this:

46
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,767
Maybe she's diabetic.

47
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,534
No. She carries
Entenmann's doughnuts

48
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,201
in her purse.

49
00:01:45,234 --> 00:01:47,667
Maybe you said something
that offended her.

50
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:49,067
The only thing
I can think of

51
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:50,234
is I told her
we should have

52
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:52,501
those moving walkways
all over the city.

53
00:01:52,534 --> 00:01:53,501
Like at the airport?

54
00:01:53,534 --> 00:01:55,401
Yeah.

55
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:56,567
That's a great idea!

56
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:57,734
Tell me about it.

57
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:59,501
We'd could be zipping
all over the place.

58
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:00,667
They could
at least try it.

59
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:01,834
They never
try anything!

60
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:03,767
What's the harm?
No harm!

61
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:06,101
I'm sorry.
There's no reason

62
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:07,401
for her
not to taste that pie.

63
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:08,601
Who wouldn't
taste the pie?

64
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:09,601
Audrey.

65
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:09,790
Dump her.

66
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,201
Dump her.

67
00:02:12,534 --> 00:02:15,001
Well, I never broke up
with anyone for not tasting pie.

68
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:18,001
I once broke up with someone
for not offering me pie.

69
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:19,667
You did?

70
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:21,034
He could be eating
a hero, Jerry.

71
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:22,667
He wouldn't
offer me anything.

72
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:23,734
It's a sickness.

73
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:26,334
Well, I can't
walk anywhere now.

74
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:27,434
I'm just gonna
be wishing

75
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:29,934
there were
walkways.

76
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:31,201
GEORGE:
What are you doin'?

77
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,534
I got a pebble.

78
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,601
Well, I never heard of that
happening to a woman.

79
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:36,434
What the hell
does that mean?

80
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:38,267
Hey.

81
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:39,790
Oh, hey, Elaine!
What?

82
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,001
Oh, hey, Elaine!
What?

83
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,067
Go like this:

84
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:43,034
What? Why?

85
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:44,367
Do it. Do it.

86
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:45,367
But--
Like this.

87
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:47,201
Like...

88
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,434
Like this?
Oh, yeah!

89
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:50,534
It's you!

90
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:51,867
What's me?

91
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:53,434
There's a clothing store
downtown.

92
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:54,701
They got a mannequin
in there

93
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:56,101
that looks
exactly like Elaine.

94
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,401
Get out!

95
00:02:57,434 --> 00:02:58,734
No, it's uncanny!

96
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:00,701
It's like they chopped off
your arms and legs,

97
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:01,701
dipped you in plastic,

98
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:03,934
then screwed you
all back together again,

99
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:05,701
and stuck you
on a pedestal.

100
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:07,067
It's really
quite exquisite.

101
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:09,790
Kramer,
what's the name

102
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,267
Kramer,
what's the name

103
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:11,701
of the store
with the mannequin?

104
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:12,701
Rinitze.

105
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,401
Oh, yeah.

106
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:15,667
Uh...

107
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:17,434
May I help you?

108
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:19,401
It's this itch.

109
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:21,001
I was watching TV
without my shirt on,

110
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,067
and one of my couch cushions
didn't have any fabric on it.

111
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:25,601
Wait a minute.
Rinitze.

112
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:26,601
Don't they have

113
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:28,034
some really
cool suits in there?

114
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:29,567
Real boss.

115
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:30,601
I'm going
down there.

116
00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:32,067
Yeah, wait.
I'm gonna go with you.

117
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:33,167
I gotta get
a new suit.

118
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:34,901
I got a second interview
with MacKenzie,

119
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:36,201
and I think
I'm really close.

120
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:38,001
They're taking me
out to lunch on Friday.

121
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:39,767
Let's go. Let's go.
All right. All right.

122
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:41,101
You gonna need this?
Keep it.

123
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:48,967
It looks
exactly like me.

124
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:52,434
It's like some pod
landed from another planet

125
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:54,701
and took your body.

126
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,234
Don't fall asleep,
Elaine.

127
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:58,034
What's going
on here?

128
00:03:58,067 --> 00:03:59,567
How do you think
this happened?

129
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:05,201
Whoa.
Look at this.

130
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:08,334
This is
a beautiful suit, huh?

131
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:09,790
You think this could be
a coincidence, George?

132
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,334
You think this could be
a coincidence, George?

133
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:11,667
Is that possible?

134
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:14,134
[EUROPEAN ACCENT]
You are perfect for that suit.

135
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:17,167
You think so?

136
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:18,167
Um,
excuse me.

137
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:19,767
Where did this
come from?

138
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,667
I don't know.

139
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:23,334
You really think
this looks okay on me?

140
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:24,534
Fabulous.
Perfect fit.

141
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:26,434
And it's
the last one we have.

142
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,934
I'm--
I'm sorry.

143
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,101
You can't tell me

144
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:31,034
where the mannequin
came from?

145
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,434
I told you,
I don't know.

146
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:38,001
Well, um, is there
somebody around here

147
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:39,790
I could talk to
who would know?

148
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,401
I could talk to
who would know?

149
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:42,267
Why?

150
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:43,267
Isn't it obvious?

151
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:45,367
This mannequin looks
exactly like me.

152
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:49,867
Did you just
roll your eyes at him?

153
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:51,367
Because let me
tell you something.

154
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:53,167
If anybody should be
rolling their eyes,

155
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:56,034
it is me, at him,
about you.

156
00:04:58,534 --> 00:05:00,334
I think maybe
you're flattering yourself.

157
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,601
That mannequin is wearing
a $1200 Gaultier dress.

158
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:05,701
What--
What are you saying,

159
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:08,667
that I'm not good enough
for this hideous dress?

160
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:09,790
Listen, Natasha.

161
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,867
Listen, Natasha.

162
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:14,267
I wouldn't be
caught dead

163
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:17,434
wearing your crummy
little Eurotrash rags.

164
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,367
I'll meet you
outside.

165
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:22,867
What is
her problem?

166
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:24,567
Ah, psh,
what can you do?

167
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:26,401
Um...

168
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:27,601
Is this
the price tag?

169
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:28,601
Yes.

170
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:31,401
Yes, hello.
Party's over.

171
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:33,001
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

172
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:34,501
We're having
an unadvertised sale

173
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,501
starting Friday.

174
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:37,601
That suit
will be half-price.

175
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:39,790
So do you think you could
put the suit aside and hold it for me?

176
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,267
So do you think you could
put the suit aside and hold it for me?

177
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:42,334
Oh, I'm afraid
I couldn't do that.

178
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:44,834
It wouldn't be fair
to the other customers.

179
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:46,501
Oh, yes,

00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:13,684
If you're one of us,
you'll take a bite.

537
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,784
So, you didn't
get the job.

538
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:21,784
No.

539
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:23,184
But I was the only one
at the table

540
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:25,217
that didn't get
violently ill.

541
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,517
Kramer, you can't keep
avoiding her like this.

542
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,385
You're gonna have
to say something.

543
00:20:29,385 --> 00:20:30,117
You're gonna have
to say something.

544
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,184
What am I supposed
to say?

545
00:20:31,217 --> 00:20:32,450
Tell her
you lost your itch.

546
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:33,784
What happened
to your itch?

547
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,517
I lost it two days ago.

548
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,617
I've been faking it

549
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,617
so I wouldn't
hurt her feelings.

550
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,150
Well, you should
tell her.

551
00:20:41,184 --> 00:20:43,784
I'll let her down easy.

552
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:45,384
All right.

553
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,184
Well...

554
00:20:48,217 --> 00:20:49,350
Hi, Olive.

555
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:52,450
No, no, no.
No more of that.

556
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,084
There's something
I have to tell you.

557
00:20:54,117 --> 00:20:55,750
What?

558
00:20:55,784 --> 00:20:57,584
Uh, well,
there's someone else.

559
00:20:57,617 --> 00:20:59,385
Someone else?
Yeah, yeah.

560
00:20:59,385 --> 00:20:59,450
Someone else?
Yeah, yeah.

561
00:20:59,484 --> 00:21:00,550
Who is she?

562
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,417
Her.

563
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,584
Her?
Yeah. There she is.

564
00:21:06,617 --> 00:21:08,084
That's my gal.

565
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:09,084
You're a liar.

566
00:21:09,117 --> 00:21:10,350
I've seen her
in here before.

567
00:21:10,384 --> 00:21:11,584
She's not
your girlfriend.

568
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:13,250
All right, now, Olive,
look, I'm sorry.

569
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:15,817
Well, why is she wearing
her underwear?

570
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,584
Uh, well,
it's a style, yeah.

571
00:21:17,617 --> 00:21:19,050
Jerry, give me
the keys.

572
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:20,850
Yo.

573
00:21:20,884 --> 00:21:22,250
Okay. Well, I guess
we're gonna

574
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:23,250
go for a drive now.

575
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:25,217
She, uh,
really loves that.

576
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:49,550
[â™ª]

577
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,252
Did you ever solve
the riddle of the pie?

578
00:21:58,286 --> 00:22:01,252
No. That's one
for the ages.

579
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,419
But I think they're gonna be
putting Poppie away

580
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:05,452
for a long, long time.

581
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:12,886
You guys, you're not gonna
believe this.

582
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:13,886
I just got a letter

583
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,252
from a friend of mine
in Chicago

584
00:22:15,286 --> 00:22:16,552
who was shopping,
and she said

585
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,986
she saw a mannequin
that looked just like me.

586
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:21,419
What if there are more?

587
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:23,019
Where are they
coming from?

588
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,552
Ricky, we've been getting

589
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:28,552
a tremendous response

590
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:30,719
to your TR-6 mannequin.

591
00:22:30,752 --> 00:22:34,552
TR-6?

592
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,819
I prefer
to think of her as...

593
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:39,586
Elaine.
