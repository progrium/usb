1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,636
So I went to a fashion show.

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:03,670
First of all,

3
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:04,971
the whole concept of modeling

4
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,541
is counterproductive
to the fashion industry,

5
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,176
because when these women
are around,

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,311
who's looking at clothes?

7
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,812
I didn't notice
any of the clothes.

8
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,314
We're all applauding. "Yeah!"

9
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,816
What are we applauding?

10
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,050
We're applauding, "There's
great-looking women here.

11
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,518
Yeah, this is great!"

12
00:00:17,552 --> 00:00:19,353
We're applauding,
"I'm glad I'm here in this room

13
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:20,354
with all these
great-looking women."

14
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,656
Anybody can design a shirt.

15
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,092
It takes talent to get
all these girls in one spot.

16
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:26,361
That's talent.

17
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:28,997
What is this goofy walk
that the models do?

18
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:30,000
You know this walk that they do
down the runway.

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,733
You know this walk that they do
down the runway.

20
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,268
This, like--
They have to go somewhere.

21
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:34,737
You know, they're walking
like they're--

22
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,105
Like they're really on the way
somewhere, you know?

23
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:39,908
And then they get to the end,
and it's like...

24
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:41,977
"Well, I guess
I'll just go back."

25
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:50,019
I loved her, Jerry.
I loved her.

26
00:00:50,053 --> 00:00:51,687
No, you didn't.

27
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:53,456
And she loved me.

28
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,091
Oh, ho, ho. She really did.

29
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:56,560
No, she didn't.

30
00:00:58,328 --> 00:01:00,630
What am I gonna do now?

31
00:01:00,664 --> 00:01:02,132
I can't live without Susan.

32
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,101
I gotta get her back.

33
00:01:04,134 --> 00:01:06,603
How? How am I gonna
get her back?

Not only didn't you love her,

35
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:09,639
you didn't even
like her.

00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:12,476

37
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:13,611

Oh, ho, ho, boy!

43
00:01:22,753 --> 00:01:24,455
Now I'll spend
the rest of my life

44
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:25,991
living alone.

45
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:28,493
I'll sit in my disgusting
little apartment,

47

48
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,831

with no underwear

49
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:35,801
'cause I'm too lazy
to do a laundry.

You walk around
with no underwear?

Yeah. What do you do
when you run out of laundry?

52
00:01:42,508 --> 00:01:43,627
I do a wash.

No one, Jerry.
No one's better than her.

56
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:54,421
When you were with her,
you said you couldn't stand her.

57
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:56,256
I loved her!

58
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:58,258
You said going up the steps
to her apartment

59
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,293
was like being taken to a cell.

60
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:03,663
I would give anything to be
going up those stairs again.
