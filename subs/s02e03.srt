00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,383
I know.

181
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:31,517
And I'll tell you
something else.

182
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,650
I'm not even gonna
ask you.

183
00:07:33,683 --> 00:07:35,617
I want to know,
but I'm not gonna ask.

184
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,683
You'll tell me
when you feel comfortable.

185
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,350
So, what was it, 400?

186
00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:44,050
Four hundred?

187
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,717
Five hundred?
Did you pay 500 for this?

188
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,850
Over 6?

189
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,617
Can't be 7.

190
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,260
Don't tell me you paid
$700 for this jacket.

191
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,483
Don't tell me you paid
$700 for this jacket.

192
00:07:52,517 --> 00:07:53,550
Did you pay $700?

193
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,350
Is that what
you're saying to me?

194
00:07:55,383 --> 00:07:56,817
You are sick!

195
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,050
Is that what you paid
for this jacket?

196
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,717
Over 700?

197
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,850
What did you pay
for this jacket?

198
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,450
I won't say anything.

199
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:07,150
I want to know what
you paid for this jacket.

200
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:08,850
Oh, my God!

201
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:09,883
A thousand dollars?

202
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:11,883
You paid a thousand dollars
for this jacket.

203
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:12,950
All right, fine,

204
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:14,517
I'm walking out of here
right now

205
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,650
thinking you paid

206
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:17,683
a thousand dollars
for this jacket,

207
00:08:17,717 --> 00:08:18,950
unless you
tell me different.

208
00:08:18,983 --> 00:08:21,250
Hah-hah! Oh!

209
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:24,483
All right,
I'll tell you what,

210
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:26,483
if you don't say anything
in the next five seconds,

211
00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:29,850
I'll know
it was over a thousand.

212
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:31,450
Hey. Hey, will you
do me a solid?

213
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:32,950
Well, what kind of solid?

214
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:35,350
Sit in the car two minutes
while it's double-parked.

215
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:36,717
I gotta pick up some birds.

216
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,883
Birds?

217
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,517
Yeah, a friend of mine,
he's a magician,

218
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,883
he's going away and asked me
to take care of his doves.

219
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:43,017
So take a cab.

220
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,283
They won't take
a cage full of birds.

221
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,550
I can't, I'm on my way out.
There's no way I can do it.

222
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:51,260
George, do me a solid.
Two minutes.

223
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,783
George, do me a solid.
Two minutes.

224
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:54,383
Well, I'm going with him.

225
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:55,717
I'd like to.

226
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,350
I've never done
a solid before.

227
00:08:58,383 --> 00:09:00,717
All right. I'll... Yeah.

228
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,850
All right, have a good one.

229
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,117
Two minutes.

230
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,050
Believe me,
I know his two minutes.

231
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,350
By his conception of time,

232
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,683

Where are they?

238
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,217
Maybe he didn't show up.

239
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,550
What, you don't want
to do this?

240
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,717
I don't think there's ever been
an appointment in my life

241
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,250
where I wanted
the other guy to show up.

242
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,583
Wait a second.
Is that him?

243
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,260
Yeah. I think it is.

244
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,383
Yeah. I think it is.

245
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,717
Where's Elaine?

246
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,683
I'm nervous.

247
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,617
Excuse me,
Mr. Benes.

248
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,617
Yeah?

249
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,883
I'm Jerry,
Elaine's friend.

250
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:02,883
This is George.

251
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:04,517
It's a great thrill
to meet you, sir.

[COUGHING]

253
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,550
Sit down.

254
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:18,683
Want a drink?

255
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:20,650
Sure.

256
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:21,260
What will you have?

257
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:21,850
What will you have?

258
00:10:21,883 --> 00:10:23,450
I'll have a cranberry juice
with two limes.

259
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:25,917
And, uh, I'll have
a club soda with no ice.

260
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,183
I'll have another scotch
with plenty of ice.

261
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:33,383
You like ice.

262
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:34,883
Huh?

263
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:37,217
I said, do you like ice?

264
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,383
Like it?

265
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:41,683
Don't you find that
you get more without it?

266
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,050
Where's Elaine?

267
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:49,050
Well, we thought she was
meeting you earlier.

268
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,083
She's usually
pretty punctual.

269
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,217
Don't you find that, George?

270
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,450
Yeah. Yeah, she's, uh...
She's punctual.

271
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:00,383
And, uh...

272
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:03,283
She's been late sometimes.

273
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:04,383
Yeah, yeah.

274
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:05,617
Sometimes she's on time,

275
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,183
and...sometimes she's late.

276
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:09,550
I guess...

277
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,683
today, she's late.

278
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,650
It appears that way.

279
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,250
Yup.
Yup.

280
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,317
Looks like rain.

281
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,883
I know, I know.
That's what they said.

282
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:27,950
Who said?

283
00:11:27,983 --> 00:11:30,550
Uh, the weather guy,
Dr. Waldo.

284
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:34,217
I don't need anybody
to tell me it's going to rain.

285
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,883
Oh, no. Of course not. I--

286
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:39,250
All I have to do
is stick my head out the window.

287
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:48,283
Which one's supposed to be
the funny guy?

288
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:50,483
Oh, he's the comedian.

289
00:11:50,517 --> 00:11:51,260
I-- I'm just
a regular person.

290
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,950
I-- I'm just
a regular person.

291
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:54,550
Nah, nah.
He's just being modest.

292
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,883
We had a funny guy
with us in Korea.

293
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,150
A tail gunner.

294
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:02,817
They blew his brains out
all over the Pacific.

295
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:08,417
There's nothing funny
about that.

296
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:23,383
Would you excuse me
a minute?

297
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:24,950
I'm going to go
to the bathroom.

298
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:25,917
I'll be right back.

299
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,283
Ahem.

300
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:46,483
I just wanted to tell you
that I really enjoyed <i>Fair Game.</i>

301
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:49,017
I thought it was just brilliant.

302
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,250
Drivel.

303
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:54,450
Yeah, well, maybe some parts.

304
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,150
What parts?

305
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,383
The, uh...

306
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,983
drivel parts.

307
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,550
Oh, my gosh.

308
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,150
I just realized
I have to make a phone call.

309
00:13:08,183 --> 00:13:11,117
I can't believe...
Would you--? I'll...

310
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,683
I'll be right back.

311
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,217
Thank you
for leaving me alone with him.

312
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,783
That was brutal.

313
00:13:19,817 --> 00:13:21,260
I can't go back out there.

314
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,683
I can't go back out there.

315
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,617
Well, let's just leave.

316
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,883
Elaine will kill me.

317
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:25,883
Where is she?

318
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:27,517
She's got to be
here soon.

319
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,550
How could she leave us
alone with this lunatic?

320
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,541
10 more minutes,
and that's it.

321
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:32,974
I'm leaving.

322
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:34,808
I have to tell you,
this guy scares me.

323
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:36,474
The waiter was trembling.

324
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:37,808
If she doesn't show up,

325
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:39,474
we can't possibly
have dinner with him alone.

326
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:41,108
How are we gonna
get out of it?

327
00:13:41,141 --> 00:13:43,908
We'll say we're frightened
and we have to go home.

328
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:47,274
Yeah. That's good.

329
00:13:47,308 --> 00:13:50,608
He'd clunk our heads
together like Moe.

330
00:13:50,641 --> 00:13:51,260
I don't know.

331
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,474
I don't know.

332
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:55,474
Just...start scratching.
Tell him you have the crabs.

333
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:57,741
He was in the military.
He'll understand that.

334
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,941
All fathers are intimidating.

335
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:06,641
They're intimidating
because they are fathers.

336
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:08,641
Once a man has children,

337
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:10,308
for the rest of his life,

338
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:12,774
his attitude is,
"The hell with the world.

339
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:14,574
"I can make my own people.

340
00:14:16,341 --> 00:14:17,641
"I'll eat whatever I want,

341
00:14:17,674 --> 00:14:19,574
"I'll wear whatever I want,

342
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,260
and I'll create whoever I want."

343
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,274
and I'll create whoever I want."

344
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,517
Who'd you call?

345
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:38,153
My...uh, uncle is, um...
having an operation.

346
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:39,986
I just wanted
to see how he was.

347
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,286
What kind of an operation?

348
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:47,053
Bone marrow.

349
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,486
Mr. Benes?

350
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,486
Yeah?

351
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,260
Message for you.

352
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,986
Message for you.

353
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,386
From Elaine.

354
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,253
She got tied up.

355
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:58,319
She'll be here in 30 minutes.

356
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,438
