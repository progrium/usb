1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,774
I was watching women

2
00:00:02,807 --> 00:00:04,774
in the department store
the other day trying on clothes,

3
00:00:04,807 --> 00:00:06,774
and I noticed that they do it
differently from men.

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:09,540
Women don't try on the clothes,

5
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:12,707
they get behind the clothes,
you see?

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,107
They take a dress off the rack,

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,774
and they hold it up
against themselves.

8
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:20,207
They can tell something
from this.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,107
They stick one leg way out.

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,474
Because they need to know

11
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:28,107
if someday I'm one-legged
at a 45-degree angle,

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,940
what am I going to wear?

13
00:00:29,974 --> 00:00:30,000
You never see a man do that.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,607
You never see a man do that.

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,774
You never see a guy
take a suit off the rack,

16
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:35,407
put his head in the neck and go,

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,774
"What do you think
about this suit?

18
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:38,407
"I think I'll get it.
Yeah, looks fine.

19
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,274

by the bottom of the pants.

20
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:41,440
"I wanna make sure.

00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:42,807
"Yeah, perfect.
Now, what if I'm walking?

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,507
Move the shoes, move the shoes,
move the shoes, move the shoes."

I'm having my root canal
the same week.

00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:19,307
Oh, right. I hope you got
a good oral surgeon,

35
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,407

very serious.

No, I don't wanna see

Been a while?

40
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:37,107
I have a vague
recollection

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,974
of doing something
with someone,

42
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:40,974
but it was a long,
long time ago.

43
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:45,540
I think my last time
was in Rochester.

44
00:01:45,574 --> 00:01:48,207
My hair was a lot shorter.

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,974
I remember
that it's a good thing...

46
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:57,074
and someday,
I hope to do it again.

47
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:06,440
What?

48
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:07,707
What?

49
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,907
What was that look?

50
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,474
What look?

51
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,707
The look you just gave me.

52
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,474
I gave a look?
Yes.

53
00:02:15,507 --> 00:02:17,074
What kind of a look?

54
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:18,740
I know that look.

55
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:19,907
So what was it?

56
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,374
Why should I tell you?

57
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:25,074
Well, you're the big
look expert.

58
00:02:25,107 --> 00:02:26,640
I want to see how smart you are.

59
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:30,000
Trust me. I know the look.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,774
Trust me. I know the look.

61
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:35,940
So?

62
00:02:35,974 --> 00:02:37,040
What?

63
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,440
What about the look?

64
00:02:38,474 --> 00:02:39,474
I don't know.

65
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:41,407
You got something on your mind?

66
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,474
No.

67
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:45,640
Things pop into your head.

68
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:46,874
You?

69
00:02:46,907 --> 00:02:49,907
Things occur to me
from time to time.

70
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,240
Yeah. Me too.

71
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:57,074
Well, you can't expect

72
00:02:57,107 --> 00:02:59,740
to just forget
the past completely.

73
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, no, of course not.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,574
Well, no, of course not.

75
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:04,640
I mean, it's something we did.

76
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:08,140
Probably about...
what, 25 times.

77
00:03:08,174 --> 00:03:09,807
37.

78
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:19,140
Yeah, we pretty much know
what we're doing in there.

79
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:21,074
We know the terrain.

80
00:03:21,107 --> 00:03:22,640
No big surprises.

81
00:03:22,674 --> 00:03:24,640
Nope.

82
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,000
What do you think?

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,774
What do you think?

84
00:03:30,807 --> 00:03:32,774
I don't know.
What do you think?

85
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:35,574
Well, it's something
to consider.

86
00:03:35,607 --> 00:03:36,607
Yeah.

87
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,374
I mean, let's say...

88
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:41,607
what if... we did?

89
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,907
What if?

90
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,274
Is that like the end
of the world or something?

91
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:46,307
Certainly not.

92
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,774
Why shouldn't we be able

93
00:03:47,807 --> 00:03:49,940
to do that once in a while
if we want to?

94
00:03:49,974 --> 00:03:50,974
I know!

95
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:53,107
I mean, really,
what is the big deal?

96
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,974
We go in there.

97
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:57,107
We're in there
for a while,

98
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,440
then we come back
out here.

99
00:03:58,474 --> 00:04:00,000
That's not complicated.

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,274
That's not complicated.

101
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,407
It's almost stupid if we didn't.

102
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,640
It's moronic.

103
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:05,507
Absurd!

104
00:04:06,907 --> 00:04:09,640
Of course...

105
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:13,774
I guess maybe some little
problems could arise.

106
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:14,907
There are always a few.

107
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,707
I mean, if anything happened,

108
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,274
and we couldn't be friends
the way we are now,

109
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:21,540
that would really be bad.

110
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:22,774
Devastating.

111
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:28,440
Because this...
is very good.

112
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:30,000
And that would be good.

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,607
And that would be good.

114
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,574
That would be good too.

115
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,607
The idea is to combine
the this...

116
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,807
and the that,

117
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,740
but this cannot
be disturbed.

118
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:44,440
Yeah, we just want
to take this...

119
00:04:44,474 --> 00:04:47,140
and... add that.

120
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:53,307
But of course,
we'd have to figure out a way

121
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,440
to avoid the things
that cause the little problems.

122
00:04:56,474 --> 00:04:57,940
Maybe some rules or something.

123
00:04:57,974 --> 00:04:59,240
Huh.

124
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:00,000
For example...

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,774
For example...

126
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:04,740
Now, I call you
whenever I'm inclined

127
00:05:04,774 --> 00:05:05,874
and vice versa...
Right.

128
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:07,240
but if we did that,

129
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:10,774
we might feel...
a certain obligation to call.

130
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:14,240
Well, why should that be?

131
00:05:14,274 --> 00:05:16,974
Oh! I have an idea.
I have an idea.

132
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:20,774
No calls the day after that.

133
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:22,640
Beautiful.

134
00:05:22,674 --> 00:05:24,140
Let's make it a rule.

135
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:25,840
All right, sir.

136
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,000
Now, here's another
little rule.

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,274
Now, here's another
little rule.

138
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:31,374
Yeah?

139
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:33,440
When we see each other now,

140
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:35,740
we retire
to our separate quarters,

141
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:38,774
but sometimes when people
get involved with that,

142
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:42,107
they feel pressure...

143
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,474
to sleep over,

144
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:47,807
when that...
is not really sleep.

145
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:53,474
Sleep is separate from that,

146
00:05:53,507 --> 00:05:58,440
and I don't see why sleep
got all tied up

147
00:05:58,474 --> 00:06:00,000
and connected...

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,940
and connected...

149
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:02,140
with that.

150
00:06:02,174 --> 00:06:05,774
Okay, okay, rule number two--

151
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:08,174
spending the night is optional.

152
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,807
Well, now
we're getting somewhere.

153
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:17,774
Good.

00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:19,607

you can handle this?

00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,307

Could he go on the land,

Could he go on the land,

178

or was he just restricted
to water?

179
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:34,649
No, I think I saw him on land

00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:54,849
This is major.

187
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:55,849
I thought you'd like that.

188
00:07:55,882 --> 00:07:57,782
Oh, this is huge!

189
00:07:57,816 --> 00:07:58,001
I know.

190
00:07:58,001 --> 00:07:59,016
I know.

191
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:01,282
All right, okay.
Let's go. Details.

192
00:08:01,316 --> 00:08:03,082
Nah, I can't give details.

193
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,449
You what?
I can't give details.

194
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:06,849
No details?

195
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:10,116
I'm not in the mood.

196
00:08:12,316 --> 00:08:14,282
You ask me here to have lunch,

197
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:16,616
tell me you slept with Elaine,

198
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:20,116
and then say you're not
in the mood for details.

199
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:22,782
Now, you listen to me.

200
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:25,249
I want details,
and I want them right now.

201
00:08:25,282 --> 00:08:27,782
I don't have a job,
I have no place to go.

202
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:28,001
You're not in the mood?

203
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:29,249
You're not in the mood?

204
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:32,482
Well, you get in the mood!

205
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:35,849
All right. Okay.

206
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,649
Well, we were in my apartment,
we're watching TV.

207
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:39,449
Where were you sitting?
On the couch.

208
00:08:39,482 --> 00:08:40,949
Next to each other?
No, separate.

209
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:42,616
Time?
Around 11:00.

210
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:44,949
Okay, go ahead.

211
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,449
So she's flipping around the TV,

212
00:08:48,482 --> 00:08:49,916
and she gets
to the naked station.

213
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:53,349
Oh... See, that's why
I don't have cable in my house,

214
00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:55,116
because of that naked station.

215
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:58,001
If I had that in my house,
I would never turn it off.

216
00:08:58,001 --> 00:08:58,782
If I had that in my house,
I would never turn it off.

217
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:00,649
I wouldn't sleep,
I wouldn't eat.

218
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:02,782
Eventually firemen would have
to break through the door.

219
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:04,516
They'd find me sitting there
in my pajamas

220
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:06,282
with drool coming down my face.

221
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:07,449
All right, all right,

222
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:08,816
so you're watching
the naked station.

223
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:11,482
And then...

224
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:14,816
somehow we started talking about
what if we had sex.

225
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:18,649
Boy, these are really
bad details.

226
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:20,582
It pains me to say this,

227
00:09:20,616 --> 00:09:22,649
but I may be getting too mature
for details.

228
00:09:22,682 --> 00:09:25,782
Oh, I hate to hear this.

229
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,982
Any kind of growth
really irritates me.

230
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:31,182
Well, I'll tell you, though,
it was really passionate.

231
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:32,482
Better than before?

232
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:36,482
She must have taken some kind of
seminar or something.

233
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:39,349
This is all too much.

234
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:41,282
So, what are you feeling,
what's going on?

235
00:09:41,316 --> 00:09:42,782
Are you, like,
a couple again now?

236
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:43,849
Not exactly.

237
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:45,349
Not exactly?
What does that mean?

238
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:50,116
Well... we've tried
to arrange a situation

239
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:52,782
where we'll be able to do this
once in a while

240
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:53,916
and still be friends.

241
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:57,282
[LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY]

242
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:03,716
What?

243
00:10:05,682 --> 00:10:07,849
Where are you living?

244
00:10:07,882 --> 00:10:09,249
Are you here?

245
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:11,082
Are you on this planet?

246
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:13,782
It's impossible.
It can't be done.

247
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:16,016
Thousands of years,
people have been trying

248
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,616
to have their cake
and eat it too.

249
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:18,749
So all of a sudden,

250
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:20,949
the two of you are gonna
come along and do it.

251
00:10:20,982 --> 00:10:22,816
Where do you get the ego?

252
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:27,282
No one can do it.
It can't be done.

253
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:28,001
I think we've
worked out a system.

254
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:28,649
I think we've
worked out a system.

255
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:30,349
Oh, you know what you're like?

256
00:10:30,382 --> 00:10:32,449
You're like a pathetic gambler.

257
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:34,249
One of these losers in Las Vegas

258
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:36,249
who keeps thinking
he's gonna come up with a way

259
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:37,249
to win at blackjack.

260
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:39,116
No, this is very advanced.

261
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:42,649
We've designed a set of rules...

262
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:44,449
that we can maintain
the friendship

263
00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:46,782
by avoiding
all the relationship pitfalls.

264
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:48,816
Sure.
All right, tell me the rules.

265
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,116
Okay.

266
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:53,816
No calls the next day.

267
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:57,782
So you have the sex,

268
00:10:57,816 --> 00:10:58,001
the next day
you don't have to call.

269
00:10:58,001 --> 00:11:00,249
the next day
you don't have to call.

270
00:11:00,282 --> 00:11:04,116
That's pretty good.

271
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:05,249
Go ahead.

272
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:06,749
You ready for the second one?

273
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:08,016
I have to tell you,

274
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:10,449
I'm very impressed
with the first one.

275
00:11:10,482 --> 00:11:13,782
Spending the night...

276
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:14,949
optional.

277
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:18,416
No. No, you see? You got greedy.

278
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:20,782
No, that's the rule.
It's optional.

279
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:24,282
I know less about women...

280
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,682
than anyone in the world,

281
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:28,001
but the one thing I do know

282
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:28,582
but the one thing I do know

283
00:11:28,616 --> 00:11:31,516
is that they are not happy
if you don't spend the night.

284
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:35,682
It could be a hot, sweaty room
with no air conditioning,

285
00:11:35,716 --> 00:11:39,416
and all they have
is a little army cot this wide.

286
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,349
You're not going anywhere.

287
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:42,616
I think you're wrong.

288
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:44,982
I hope I am.

289
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:49,482
Is this yours
or the roommate's?

290
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:50,616
The roommate's.

291
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:51,782
Would she mind?

292
00:11:51,816 --> 00:11:53,582
She keeps track
of everything.

293
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:56,482
Yes, well, that's too bad,
because I'm taking it.

294
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,001
Thanks.

295
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:58,282
Thanks.

296
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:00,116
Well...

297
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:01,649
guess I'll get going.

298
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:03,682
Oh.

299
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:05,616
Well, I've got that root canal
tomorrow morning.

300
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:06,982
It'd be easier if I go home.

301
00:12:07,016 --> 00:12:08,449
Fine. Go ahead.

302
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:10,616
I don't understand.
Is there a problem?

303
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,982
I'm-I'm getting the impression
there's a problem.

304
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:17,449
Just go.

305
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:18,816
I'm having surgery tomorrow!

306
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:20,482
Oh, surgery.
You're going to the dentist!

307
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:22,616
But you said!
It could be very serious!

308
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:25,116
Okay. So, fine. Go!

309
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:26,416
What happened to the rules?

310
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:28,001
Remember?
Sleeping over was optional.

311
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:28,649
Remember?
Sleeping over was optional.

312
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,082
Yeah, it's my house,
it's my option.

313
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,082
It has nothing to do
with whose house it is.

314
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:33,616
Oh, of course it does!

315
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:35,116
Hi.

316
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:36,182
Hi.
Hi.

317
00:12:36,216 --> 00:12:37,449
Hi, Jerry.

318
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:38,949
Hi.

319
00:12:38,982 --> 00:12:40,316
Such a great
improv class tonight.

320
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:41,449
Oh, really?

321
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:45,082
I did this improv...

322
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:46,616
where I pretended

323
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,449
I was working
in one of those booths,

324
00:12:48,482 --> 00:12:49,949
you know,
in an amusement park

325
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:51,782
where you shoot the water
in the clown's mouth,

326
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:53,082
and you blow up
the balloon?

327
00:12:53,116 --> 00:12:57,282
Uh, Tina, could you excuse us
for just one second?

328
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:58,001
Oh, yeah.

329
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:00,149
Oh, yeah.

330
00:13:00,182 --> 00:13:02,882
I'll excuse you.

331
00:13:07,282 --> 00:13:08,849
What are you doing?

332
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:10,082
I can't go if you're mad.

333
00:13:10,116 --> 00:13:11,616
I'm not mad.

334
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:13,916
You still seem a little mad.

335
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:17,649
No, no, Jerry, I'm fine.
Really, it's okay.

336
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:20,116
So you're okay
with everything?

337
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:22,016
Definitely. Are you?

338
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:24,849
Definitely.

339
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:28,001
Well... good night.

340
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,649
Well... good night.

341
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:31,316
Good ni--
What are you doing?

342
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:32,316
What?

343
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:34,616
The rules.

344
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:37,349
Hey, who took my cake?

345
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,714
What about jewelry?
That's a nice birthday gift.

346
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:50,414
No, no, I have to be
very careful here.

347
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:52,414
I don't want to send
the wrong message,

348
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:53,914
especially after
the other night.

349
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:55,880
Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.

350
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:58,980
No, no, you can't get her
anything better than me.

351
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:01,180
Whatever I spend,
you have to spend half.

352
00:14:01,214 --> 00:14:03,214
What am I supposed to get her,
Bazooka?

353
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:07,180
You don't understand.
I'm in a very delicate position.

354
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:10,147
Whatever I give her, she's gonna
be bringing in experts

355
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,029
from all over the country

356
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:11,214
from all over the country

357
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:13,047
to interpret
the meaning behind it.

358
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:16,514
What does she need?

359
00:14:16,547 --> 00:14:19,314
Maybe there's something
that she needs.

360
00:14:19,347 --> 00:14:23,680
I think I heard her say
something about a bench.

361
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:25,880
A bench?
What kind of a bench?

362
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:27,980
I don't know.
She mentioned a bench.

363
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:30,380
What, like at a bus stop?

364
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:32,847
I don't know.

365
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,814
Like a park bench?

366
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:36,047
I have no idea.

367
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,480
Who puts a bench in the house?

368
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:39,380
Forget the bench!

369
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,029
I got it.

370
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:41,214
I got it.

371
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,647
You want to get her
something nice?

372
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,647
What about
a music box?

373
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,847
Nah, too relationship-y.

374
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,714
She opens it up, she hears
that "Lara's Theme," I'm dead.

375
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:56,680
Okay, what about a nice frame

376
00:14:56,714 --> 00:14:59,380
with a picture
of another guy in it?

377
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:02,247
The frame says "I care for you,
but if you want to get serious,

378
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,880
perhaps you'd be interested
in someone like this."

379
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:06,880
Nice-looking fella.

380
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:08,180
What about candle holders?

381
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:09,347
Too romantic.

382
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,514
Lingerie?

383
00:15:10,547 --> 00:15:11,029
Too sexual.

384
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:11,547
Too sexual.

385
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,680
Waffle maker?

386
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:14,847
Too domestic.

387
00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:18,347
Bust of Nelson Rockefeller?

388
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,847
Too... gubernatorial.

389
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:26,047
Let's work on the card.

390
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,047
I had to buy a gift for someone.

391
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,680
The hardest part, to me,
is that card.

392
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:30,847
That card is the killer.

393
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,714
I never know
what it's supposed to say,

394
00:15:32,747 --> 00:15:34,480
and it's getting so tough

395
00:15:34,514 --> 00:15:36,347
because the relationships
are becoming so complicated,

396
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,147
greeting card companies
now put out cards

397
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,029
that are blank on the inside.

398
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:41,347
that are blank on the inside.

399
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,914
Nothing. No message.

400
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:44,747
I mean, it's like
the card company says,

401
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,047
"We give up. You think
of something," you know?

402
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,914
"For 75 cents,
I don't want to get involved."

403
00:15:52,447 --> 00:15:53,547
Maybe you won't like it.

404
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,980
Oh, how could I
not like it?

405
00:15:55,014 --> 00:15:56,014
Of course I'll like it.

406
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:57,080
You could not like it.

407
00:15:57,114 --> 00:15:59,347
Just the fact
that you remembered

408
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,914
means everything.

409
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:02,747
Of course I remembered.

410
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,480
You reminded me every day
for two months.

411
00:16:04,514 --> 00:16:06,414
[CHUCKLES]

412
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:07,847
Oh, the card.

413
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,647
Cash?

414
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,880
What do you think?

415
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:29,480
You got me cash?

416
00:16:29,514 --> 00:16:31,314
Well, this way,
I figure you could go out

417
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:32,847
and get yourself
whatever you want.

418
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,980
No good?

419
00:16:34,014 --> 00:16:37,147
Who are you, my uncle?

420
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,680
Hey, come on, that's $182 there.

421
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:40,247
I don't think that's
anything to sneeze at.

422
00:16:44,714 --> 00:16:47,714
Let me see the card.

423
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:55,080
"To a wonderful girl,

424
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:59,047
a great pal, and more?"

425
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,414
Hey.

426
00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:06,080
Oh, Elaine,
I'm glad you're here.

427
00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:07,347
Stay-- stay
right here.

428
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,514
I'm gonna be
right back. Stay.

429
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:11,029
Pal? You think I'm your pal?

430
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:13,514
Pal? You think I'm your pal?

431
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:15,614
I said, "And more."

432
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,414
I am not your pal.

433
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:22,980
What's wrong with pal?

434
00:17:23,014 --> 00:17:25,014
Why is everybody so down on pal?

435
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:26,747
Here.

436
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,214
Oh, what is this?

437
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:30,514
You got me something?

438
00:17:30,547 --> 00:17:31,847
Yeah. Yeah. Open it.

439
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,447
Oh, Kramer!

440
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:36,580
Oh! The bench!

441
00:17:36,614 --> 00:17:38,714
You got me the bench
that I wanted!

442
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,180
That's pretty good, huh?
Great.

443
00:17:46,214 --> 00:17:48,180
Remember when we were standing
there, and she mentioned it?

444
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:49,547
I made a mental note of it.

445
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,347
Well, goodie for you.

446
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,247
Oh, yeah. See,
I'm very sensitive about that.

447
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,847
I mean, someone's birthday
comes up,

448
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,047
I keep my ears open.

449
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,214
So, what did you get her?

450
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,647
182 bucks.

451
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,514
Cash?

452
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,347
You gotta be kidding.
What kind of gift is that?

453
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,029
That's like something
her uncle would give her.

454
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:12,014
That's like something
her uncle would give her.

455
00:18:14,047 --> 00:18:19,414
Think where man's glory
most begins and ends,

456
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:23,380
and say my glory was
I had such a friend.

457
00:18:23,414 --> 00:18:25,280
Yeats.

458
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:30,180
Oh, Kramer...

459
00:18:30,214 --> 00:18:31,547
Yeah...

460
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:36,380
Could you
excuse us, please?

461
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:37,380
Well, what?

462
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:39,680
We're talking.

463
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:41,029
Oh, the relationship.

464
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:42,847
Oh, the relationship.

465
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,247
You know, we never
had one fight

466
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,247
before this deal.

467
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,347
I know.

468
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,480
Never.
Ever.

469
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:58,180
We got along
beautifully.

470
00:18:58,214 --> 00:18:59,347
Like clams.

471
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,380
It was wonderful.

472
00:19:00,414 --> 00:19:02,047
A pleasure.

473
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,214
So I think we should just
forget the whole deal

474
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:06,680
and go back
to being friends.

475
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:11,029
I can't do it.

476
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,647
I can't do it.

477
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,547
You what?

478
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,680
I can't do that.

479
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:20,747
You mean, it's...

480
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:23,380
No this?

481
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:26,547
No that?

482
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:35,514
No this or that.
Oh, boy.

483
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:37,347
Hmm.

484
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,180
What do you want?

485
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:41,029
This, that,
and the other.

486
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:42,680
This, that,
and the other.

487
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,580
Oh, sure, of course.
You're entitled.

488
00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:47,680
Who doesn't want this,
that, and the other?

489
00:19:47,714 --> 00:19:50,347
You.

490
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,280
Well...

491
00:19:54,014 --> 00:19:56,314
Oh, those birthdays.

492
00:19:56,347 --> 00:19:59,647
I told you,
they're relationship killers.

493
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,347
If a relationship is having
any problems whatsoever,

494
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,047
a birthday will always
bring it out.

495
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,214
I never should've made up
those rules.

496
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:10,514
What is it about sex
that just disrupts everything?

497
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:11,029
Is it the touching,
is it the nudity?

498
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:12,080
Is it the touching,
is it the nudity?

499
00:20:12,114 --> 00:20:14,980
It can't be the nudity.

500
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,814
I never got into these
terrible kind of fights

501
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:18,147
and misunderstandings

502
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,047
when I was changing
before gym class.

503
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,514
You know what this means?
I can't see her anymore, either.

504
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:25,580
Why?

505
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:30,547
It's breakup by association.

506
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,647
Besides, she's mad at me anyway
because of my birthday present.

507
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,014
What? What did you wind up
giving her?

508
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:39,547
$91.

509
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:44,347
Sorry about that.

510
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,514
So, what are you gonna do?

511
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:49,247
Well, if I do call her,

512
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,914
there's no joking around
anymore.

513
00:20:50,947 --> 00:20:52,014
This is pretty much it.

514
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:54,480
So maybe this should be it.

515
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:55,980
It could be it.

516
00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:57,880
She seems like an it.

517
00:20:57,914 --> 00:21:00,647
She's as it as you get.

518
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,680
Imagine bumping into her
on the street in five years

519
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:04,680
with a husband?

520
00:21:04,714 --> 00:21:06,347
And she tells me
that he's a sculptor,

521
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,547
they live in Vermont.

522
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,680
[SNORTS]

523
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:09,914
We'd have to kill him.

524
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:11,029
We'd get caught.
I'd get the chair.

525
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:12,647
We'd get caught.
I'd get the chair.

526
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,480
I'd go to prison
as your accomplice.

527
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:19,847
Have to wear
that really heavy denim.

528
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,247
Go to the cafeteria line,

529
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,714
with the guy who slops those
mashed potatoes onto your plate.

530
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:27,847
Go to the bathroom
in front of hundreds of people.

531
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Plus, you know what else.

532
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,080
You better call her.

533
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:38,014
Hey.
Hey.

534
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,014
You got the paper yet?

535
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,480
Yeah.

536
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:41,029
Well, where is it?

537
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:42,114
Well, where is it?

538
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:45,347
Hey, are you done
with that?

539
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,547
No.

540
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,714
Well, you're not
reading it now.

541
00:21:49,547 --> 00:21:50,847
All right,
you can take it,

542
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,980
but I want it back.

543
00:21:52,014 --> 00:21:53,414
Oh, yeah.

544
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:59,514
So, uh, what are you guys
gonna do today?

545
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:03,014
Oh, this and...

546
00:22:03,047 --> 00:22:04,080
that.

547
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,680
And the other.

548
00:22:07,114 --> 00:22:09,880
Boy, I really liked
the two of you much better

549
00:22:09,914 --> 00:22:11,029
when you weren't a couple.

550
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,847
when you weren't a couple.

551
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:26,714
Why is commitment
such a big problem for a man?

552
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:28,480
I think that for some reason,

553
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:32,547
when a man is driving
down that freeway of life,

554
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,514
the woman's he's involved with
is like an exit,

555
00:22:35,547 --> 00:22:38,347
but he doesn't want to get out.
He wants to keep driving,

556
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,647
and the woman is like, "Look,
gas, food, lodging.

557
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,814
"That's our exit.

558
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:43,747
"That's everything we need
to be happy.

559
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,747
Get out of here now!"

560
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,580
But the man is focusing
on the sign underneath

561
00:22:49,614 --> 00:22:50,881
that says,
"Next exit-- 27 miles,"

562
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:50,914
that says,
"Next exit-- 27 miles,"

563
00:22:50,947 --> 00:22:52,614
and he thinks, "I can make it."
