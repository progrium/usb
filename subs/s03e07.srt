365
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,366
Of course.
You're very smart man. I listen.

I am not a restauranteur
by any means,

367
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:52,233
but it occurred to me
that perhaps you might serve

368
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:54,466
some dishes
from your native Pakistan,

369
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,033
as opposed to, say,

370
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:58,033

for example.

371

Pakistani people here.

authentic Pakistani restaurant

540
00:18:38,554 --> 00:18:41,021
Come on, George,
open up.

541
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:50,754
Well?

542
00:18:50,787 --> 00:18:53,321
How you doing?

543
00:18:53,354 --> 00:18:55,154
Where's the test?

544
00:18:55,187 --> 00:18:58,587
You know,
it's the damnedest thing.

545
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:01,787
I went out the window again
to get a cup of coffee...

546
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:10,821
Babu...

547
00:19:10,854 --> 00:19:13,987
Babu.

548
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:18,059
Babu, you know...

549
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:19,754
Babu, you know...

550
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:21,854
I've got to tell you.

551
00:19:21,887 --> 00:19:24,687
I never do this, but the shrimp,

552
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:26,521
it's just
it's a little stringy.

553
00:19:26,554 --> 00:19:29,521
You have any chicken?

554
00:19:29,554 --> 00:19:30,654
The shrimp is stringy?

555
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,654
Well, maybe your fridge--

556
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:32,621
Quiet!

557
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:34,687
No, I--

558
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:36,154
You shut up!

559
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:37,254
Well, I...

560
00:19:37,287 --> 00:19:38,254
You make me
change restaurant,

561
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:39,854
but nobody come.

562
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,687
You say, "Make Pakistani."

563
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:44,087
Babu Bhatt have
only Pakistani restaurant,

564
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:45,521
but where are people?

565
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:47,021
You see people?

566
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:48,059
Show me people.

567
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:48,521
Show me people.

568
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,987
There are no people!

569
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:52,321
You know, I think
I'll just take the check.

Are you looking for George?

575
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:17,054
Well, uh... kind of.

576
00:20:18,221 --> 00:20:19,787
George left.

577
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:20,954
Oh.

578
00:20:22,787 --> 00:20:25,121
Is that the test?

579
00:20:25,154 --> 00:20:26,121
Oh.

580
00:20:26,154 --> 00:20:29,421
This, um...

581
00:20:29,454 --> 00:20:32,021
Yeah.

582

Here you go.
Thanks.

583

I hope you do
a lot better this time.

584
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:42,787
Actually, you know,
I think I did.

585
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:43,787
The first time,

586
00:20:43,821 --> 00:20:47,887
I couldn't really
con...centrate.

You know what it was--
bad location.

Come on, let's not
stand here too long.

589
00:21:00,654 --> 00:21:01,787
We might run into him.

590
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:04,821
Aren't you cold?
Where's your jacket?

591
00:21:04,854 --> 00:21:06,921
Oh, sorry.

592
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:08,887
I'm going upstairs.

593
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:12,287
Hey, guys!
Hey.

594
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:13,587

598
00:21:18,554 --> 00:21:20,354
151?

599
00:21:20,387 --> 00:21:21,321
Yeah.

600
00:21:23,287 --> 00:21:24,421
That's a good score.

601
00:21:24,454 --> 00:21:26,821
So, what are you up for?
How about Mexican?

602
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:27,821

603
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:29,254
No. Chinese.

your Batmen, your Spidermen,
your Elasticmen.

609
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:58,036
They're all wearing disguises,

610
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:00,236
masks over their faces,
secret identities.

611
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:03,436
Don't want people
to know who they are.

612
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:05,103
Too much aggravation.

613
00:22:05,136 --> 00:22:07,469
Superman, yeah,
thanks for saving my life,

614
00:22:07,503 --> 00:22:10,303
but did you
have to come through my wall?

615
00:22:10,336 --> 00:22:13,269
I'm renting here.
They got a security deposit.

616
00:22:13,303 --> 00:22:14,178
What am I supposed to do?

617
00:22:14,178 --> 00:22:14,803
What am I supposed to do?
