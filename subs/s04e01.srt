00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,535
I think you'd be
great in, you know.

362
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:37,102
So maybe I could
give it to you.

363
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:38,302
Okay, thanks a lot.
Excuse me.

364
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:39,302
Are you going now?
Uh-huh.

365
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:40,268
Bye.
Oh, wait, wait.

366
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:47,027
JERRY:
Yeah, that's Kramer,

367
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:47,202

Yeah, that's Kramer,

K-R-A-M-E-R.

369
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,935
Um... I don't know,
wavy?

370
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:54,368
George, how would you
describe Kramer's hair?

371
00:11:54,402 --> 00:11:55,368
Curly.

372
00:11:55,402 --> 00:11:56,368
Wavy.

373
00:11:56,402 --> 00:11:57,702
What'd you ask me for?

374
00:11:57,735 --> 00:11:58,868
Yeah. I'll hold on.

375
00:11:58,902 --> 00:12:00,768
Hey, George,
did you see a piece of paper

376
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:02,035
I had on the nightstand here,

377
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:03,768
like, crumpled up like a napkin?

378
00:12:03,802 --> 00:12:05,035
No.

379
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:06,635
Because I had, like,
three jokes on it.

380
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:07,802
They were all perfectly worded,

381
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:10,402
just the way
I wanted to have it.

382
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:12,235
I can't find it.

383
00:12:12,268 --> 00:12:13,468

I don't know, 6'3"?

386
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:17,302
I don't know, 6'3"?

387
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:18,768
George, how tall is Kramer?

388
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:21,468
Hey, you got
your own shampoo, conditioner.

389
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:22,468
Body lotion!

390
00:12:22,502 --> 00:12:24,902
Jerry, body lotion!
Whoo-hoo!

391
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:25,902
About 6'3".

Come in!

395
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:36,535
Hello. I have
more towels.

00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:39,135
Oh, good, good.
Come in, come in.

397
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:40,935
Welcome.
Um, I'm George.

Oh, hello.

399
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:43,968
Hi, and this is Jerry.

400
00:12:44,002 --> 00:12:44,968
Over there,
on the phone.

401
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:45,968
That's Jerry.

402
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:47,027
And you are, um...?
Lupe.

403
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:47,302
And you are, um...?
Lupe.

404
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:49,768
Lupe. That's very nice,
very nice.

405
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:50,768
Listen, are you gonna be

406
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:52,202
making up the bed
in the morning?

407
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:53,202
Oh, yes.

408
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:54,368
Fine, excellent.

409
00:12:54,402 --> 00:12:56,702
Could you do me a favor?

410
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,735
Could you not
tuck the blankets in?

411
00:12:59,768 --> 00:13:01,568
Because I can't sleep
all tucked in.

412
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:03,402
Oh, yes, yes.

413
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:04,968
Yes, yes,
I like to just be able

414
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:07,635
to take the blankets
and swish them and swirl them.

415
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:08,902
You know what I mean?

416
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:11,602
You know,
I don't like them all tucked in.

417
00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:12,735
I just don't.

418
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:14,735
I like to have a lot of room,
you know.

419
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:16,968
I like to have
my toes pointed up in the air.

420
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:17,027
I just like
to scrunch up the blankets.

421
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:18,902
I just like
to scrunch up the blankets.

422
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:21,735
Yes, yes.
It's too tight to sleep.

423
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:22,768
Exactly.

424
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,268
You know what
I'm talking about, right?

425
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:26,602
Oh, yes.
It's too tight.

426
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:28,435
Um, him, too?

427
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:30,468
Oh, uh, Jerry, you want
your blankets tucked in?

428
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:31,868
Excuse me.
What?

429
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:33,535
You want your blankets
tucked in? What blankets?

430
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:34,868
When Lupe makes up
the beds.

431
00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:37,035
I don't know, whatever they do.

432
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:38,902
I tuck in...yes?

433
00:13:38,935 --> 00:13:40,935
Tuck in. Tuck in.

434
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:41,935
All right,

435
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:44,868
so that's one tuck
and one no-tuck.

436
00:13:44,902 --> 00:13:46,868
Okay.
Yes, one second, sweetheart.

437
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:47,027
Jerry,
I really think it'd be easier

438
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,235
Jerry,
I really think it'd be easier

439
00:13:48,268 --> 00:13:49,235
if you didn't tuck.

440
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:50,235
Excuse me.

441
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:51,902
Fine, you don't
want me to tuck,

442
00:13:51,935 --> 00:13:54,735
put me down
for a no-tuck.

443
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,435
That's two no-tucks.

444
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,735
Hang on a second.
You know what?

445
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:00,535
Changed my mind.
Make it a tuck.

446
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:02,468
You just said
you weren't tucking.

447
00:14:02,502 --> 00:14:04,535
I'm tucking!

448
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:05,568
Hello?

449
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:06,902
Hello?

450
00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:09,235
They hung up on me.

451
00:14:09,268 --> 00:14:10,802
They don't know
where Kramer is anyway.

452
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:12,535
Alrighty, so,

453
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:14,568
that's one tuck and one no-tuck.

454
00:14:14,602 --> 00:14:15,568
You got that?

455
00:14:15,602 --> 00:14:16,735
Okay.

456
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:17,027
Excuse me.

457
00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:17,735
Excuse me.

458
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:19,602
Did you see a piece of paper

459
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:21,368
on the nightstand
here earlier today

460
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,535
crumpled up like a napkin?

461
00:14:22,568 --> 00:14:23,868
Oh, yes, yes.

462
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:26,268
I throw away when
we clean the room.

463
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:27,268
Oh, okay, thanks.

464
00:14:27,302 --> 00:14:28,268
Okay, thank you.

465
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:29,268
Thank you.

466
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:30,268
Bye-bye.

467
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,268
All right, Lupe,
bye-bye, now.

468
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:32,468
Bye.
Bye-bye.

469
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:35,035
I can't believe
she threw that out.

470
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:36,702
I had, like,
the perfect wording

471
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:38,468
of a whole joke
I was going to do

472
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,868
about the x-ray counter
at the airport.

473
00:14:39,902 --> 00:14:42,202
I was going to do it.
Now I can't remember it.

474
00:14:42,235 --> 00:14:44,635
What'd you want her to do?
You left it on the table.

475
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:46,802
They're not supposed to take
everything and throw it out.

476
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:47,027
Hey, hey, hey!

477
00:14:47,027 --> 00:14:49,035
Hey, hey, hey!

478
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:50,635
It's not Lupe's fault.

479
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:51,902
You shouldn't have left it out.

480
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:52,902
All right.

481
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,068
Just get
your thing together,

482
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,435
and let's get out of here.

483
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:56,968
All right. Now...

484
00:14:57,002 --> 00:14:58,202
what mood am I in?

485
00:14:58,235 --> 00:14:59,368
What mood am I in?

486
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:00,468

Hey, lieutenant?
Yeah.

490
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:27,349
This was found
on her person.

491
00:15:27,383 --> 00:15:29,383
On her person?

492
00:15:30,616 --> 00:15:32,183
What kind of expression is that?

493
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:33,983
I don't know, sir.

499
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:43,516
You see that person there, Ross?

500
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:44,516
Yes, sir.

501
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:46,049
She's dead.

502
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,027
Have you got that?

503
00:15:47,027 --> 00:15:47,316
Have you got that?

504
00:15:47,349 --> 00:15:48,316
Yes, sir.

505
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:49,316
Good.

506
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:50,483
Now, get out of here

507
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,016

I don't know.

00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:16,716
You might
meet a celebrity.

516
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:17,027
I can't believe
she threw out my napkin.

517
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:18,516
I can't believe
she threw out my napkin.

What're you worried about?
You know it!

Go, go about your business.

522
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:26,983
I'll just wander around.

523
00:16:27,016 --> 00:16:28,683
All right,
don't wander too far.

00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,027
GEORGE:
So, mind you, at this point,

541
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:17,983
GEORGE:
So, mind you, at this point,

542
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:19,883
I'm only going
out with her

543
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,383
two, three weeks.

544
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,383
So she goes out of town,

545
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,416
and she asks me
to feed her cat.

546
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:29,316
So, at this time...

547
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:33,649
there's a lot of stuff
going on in my life, and, uh...

548
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:36,849
It slips my mind
for a few days.

549
00:17:36,883 --> 00:17:37,849
Maybe a week.

550
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:39,583
Not even a week.
Five, six days--

551
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:40,983
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, what happened?

552
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:43,483
Well...

553
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:45,583
It's the damndest thing.

554
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:46,949
The cat dies.

555
00:17:49,449 --> 00:17:51,049
So she comes back into town,

556
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,649
she finds the cat
lying on the carpet

557
00:17:52,683 --> 00:17:53,683
stiff as a board.

558
00:17:53,716 --> 00:17:55,583
So you killed the cat?

559
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,649
That's what
she says.

560
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:59,583
I say, "Listen.

561
00:17:59,616 --> 00:18:01,416
"It was an old cat.

562
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:03,649
It died of natural causes."

563
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:04,649
So get this.

564
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,883
Now, she tells me

565
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,916
that I got to buy her
a brand-new cat.

566
00:18:07,949 --> 00:18:11,349
I say, "Listen, honey,
first of all,

567
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:12,983
"it was a pretty old cat.

568
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:15,349
"I'm not gonna buy you
a brand-new cat

569
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:17,027
"to replace
an old dying cat.

570
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:17,416
"to replace
an old dying cat.

571
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:19,883
"And second of all,
I go out to the garbage,

572
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,516
I'll find you a new cat
in 15 seconds."

573
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:24,516
I say,
"You show me an autopsy report

574
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:26,383
"that says
this cat died of starvation,

575
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,049
I spring for a new cat."

576
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,316
So she says something
to me, like...

577
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:33,749
I don't know,
"Get the hell outta here,"

578
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:35,549
and she breaks up with me.

579
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,716
Now, don't you think
that would be

580
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,016
a great case
on <i>L.A. Law?</i>

581
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,316
I don't want to tell you
how to run your show.

582
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:47,027
No, of course not.

583
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:47,683
No, of course not.

584
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:48,883
It's enough
with the bar already,

585
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:49,883
you know what I'm saying?

586
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,249
Seriously,

587
00:18:51,283 --> 00:18:53,183
have they thought
about changing the setting?

588
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,549
Doubt it. I doubt it.
Really.

589
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,849
Because people do meet
in places besides a bar.

590
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:58,549
Well, yeah, they do.

591
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,683
What about a rec room, huh?

592
00:18:59,716 --> 00:19:01,216
Uh, yeah.
Huh?

593
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:02,849
Or a community center.

594
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,483
Yeah,
you ought to write one of those.

595
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:05,683
Yeah?

I'll bring it up with the
producer. I gotta, uh...

597
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:08,883
Fabulous. I'll think
about that, George.

598
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,683
Thank you.

599
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:11,683
How's it going?

600
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:12,883
Great! Great!

601
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,216
I actually just had

602
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:16,683
two meaningful,
intelligent conversations

00:19:16,716 --> 00:19:17,027

Yeah, yeah.

Not fan talk. Not gushing,
you know.

00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,183

me a great case for <i>L.A. Law.</i>

616
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:51,183
Just a few seconds ago,
right outside in the hallway,

617
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:53,716
this nut, some sick nut,
comes up to me and says

618
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:57,916
he was supposed
to watch this girl's cat

619
00:19:57,949 --> 00:19:59,349
while she was away
out of town.

620
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:01,049
Anyway,
he forgets to feed the cat.

621
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,916
The cat dies, starves to death.

622
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:04,049
He kills the cat,

623
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,316
refuses to get her a new one,

624
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:08,849
won't give her any money,
won't pay her,

625
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:11,349
and he wants Arnie Becker
to represent him. Nice guy.

626
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:13,349
"Yeah, that'd make
a great case for <i>L.A. Law."</i>

handsome man.

He's a very
handsome man.

630
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:21,249
Passionate, intense,

631
00:20:21,283 --> 00:20:24,583
but troubled, strange.

632
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:27,583
I think he may be
in love with me.

633
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:29,516
Of course, there's nothing
abnormal about that.

634
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:31,883
I have many suitors.

635
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,349
It's funny, because
even after all these years,

636
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:36,083
we still get people,
you know,

637
00:20:36,116 --> 00:20:38,916
giving us advice,
how to improve the show.

638
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:42,249
Actually, a few moments ago,
I ran into a nut back there

639
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,416
who said, you know,
maybe we should think about,

640
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:47,027

not doing the show in a bar.

not doing the show in a bar.

00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:55,749
So that's when I said,
"Hey, Kramer, dude,

643
00:20:55,783 --> 00:20:57,983
have you ever
killed a man before?"

644
00:20:58,016 --> 00:21:01,416
And he said,
"What do you think, junior?!

00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:04,216

in Ivory Liquid?"
