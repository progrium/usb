Well, you didn't have to say it
like that.

00:18:37,722 --> 00:18:40,155
I want you out of here
by the end of the day.

What about the whole
Christmas spirit thing?

Any flexibility there?

She wanted me to give you this.

543
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:18,622
You had sex on your desk
with the cleaning woman.

544
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,222
You never had sex
in the office before?

545
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:23,455
No. I once made out
with someone,

546
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:24,219
but that's it.

00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:24,455

00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:26,722
Okay. All right.
So you made out.

549
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:27,955
Well, that's not sex.

550
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:29,222
Kissing is sex.

Hey...

554
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:38,388
Did Jerry leave that drink
next to Dick's on purpose?

555
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:39,555
No.

Hey, Jerry,

562
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,055
when do you consider
sex has taken place?

563
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:54,219
I would say, uh...

564
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:54,622
I would say, uh...

565
00:19:54,655 --> 00:19:56,388
when the nipple makes
its first appearance.

566
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:03,722
So, uh,

567
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:06,388

that you left the drink

heckled me

and I hate being around
alcoholics

how much they love you
