NARRATOR:
Here's what happened last week.

2
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:04,366
So George and I
went up to NBC,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,166
and we told them
the idea for the series.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,800
Now we're just waiting
to sign the contract.

5
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:09,366
Jerry, I want you
to sign that contract.

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,533
We're gonna sign it!

7
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:12,800
In fact, George is out
with the woman from NBC now.

8
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,800
I'm afraid we're
gonna have to pass.

9
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:15,800
You're passing?

10
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,033
Well, it's much too low.

11
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:20,033
That's it for this piece
of junk. I've had it.

12
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:21,633
Is that the one
your parents gave you?

13
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:22,900
Yeah, but
it never works!

14
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:24,733
Where's that watch
we bought you? At the jeweler.

15
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:26,333
I would like somebody to hit me.

16
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:28,166
So, what's the matter
with this Davola guy?

17
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,666
He's after Jerry now.

18
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,000
You know, I never
had a back problem

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,300
You know, I never
had a back problem

20
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,333
until that night I slept
on the convertible sofa.

21
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:36,400
Cuban cigars.

22
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:37,866
It's a present from my father.

23
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,066
Here you go.

24
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,400
What? Oh, cigars?
Yeah. Cubans.

00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:44,566
What's wrong?

28
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,400
The Velcro.
I can't stand Velcro.

29
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:48,000
That tearing sound.

30
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:50,900
Now, listen to me.
I'm negotiating.

31
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:52,066
Negotiation.

32
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,000
This is what you do
in business.

33
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,000
Leave all my stuff here?
Leave it.

34
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:58,000
Tell us about the trip.
How's Dr. Reston?

35
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,000
He has this power over me, okay?
I mean, he has this way

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,833
He has this power over me, okay?
I mean, he has this way

37
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:03,666
of manipulating
every little word that I say.

38
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,400
He's like a "Svenjolly."

39
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:07,033
You tell this guy
you're seeing somebody else.

40
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:08,633
That's the easiest way
to get out.

41
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,533
His name is...
Kramer.

42
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:12,633
Tell this young man
to give me a call.

a perfectly good watch?

48
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,300
It's an entire industry
of bad gifts, aren't they?

49
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,566
All those executive gifts,

50
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,000
any stupid, goofy,
brass, wood thing.

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,033
any stupid, goofy,
brass, wood thing.

52
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:34,033
They put a piece of green felt
on the bottom.

53
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:38,366
"It's a golf, desk, tie
and stress organizer, Dad."

54
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,533
To me, nothing compares
with the paperweight

55
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:41,700
as a bad gift.

56
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:43,866
There's no better way
than a paperweight

57
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,500
to express to someone that,

58
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:50,000
"I refuse to put any thought
into this at all."

59
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:51,466
Where are these people working

60
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,000
that the papers are just blowing
right off of their desk?

61
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:56,366
What, are their desks screwed
to the back of a flatbed truck

62
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,833
going down the highway
or something?

63
00:01:57,866 --> 00:01:59,666
What, are they typing
up in the crow's-nest

64
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,000
of a clipper ship?

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,900

He brings in a watch,
it takes over a week to fix.

00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,166
He fixed yours in one day.

Oh, you know
these jewelers.

72
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:17,833
They're enigmas.

wrapped in a riddle.

00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:24,400
She's okay.

She's better than nice.

00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:29,400
She's beautiful.

80
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:30,666
She's not beautiful.

81
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,000
I think she's beautiful.

82
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,466
So you ask her out.

83
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,291
I'm not gonna ask her out.
Why not?

84
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,233
I'm not gonna ask her out.
Why not?

85
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:36,533
If you don't think
she's beautiful,

86
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:37,833
there's something wrong
with you.

87
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,000
She's pretty.
She's not beautiful.

88
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:42,900
I should drop dead
if she's not beautiful.

89
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:45,133

and him a day.

Something's fishy
about this.

"The hell with them."

00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,666
"The hell with them"?

and no experience more money?"
