NARRATOR:
Here's what happened last week.

2
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:04,366
So George and I
went up to NBC,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,166
and we told them
the idea for the series.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,800
Now we're just waiting
to sign the contract.

5
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:09,366
Jerry, I want you
to sign that contract.

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,533
We're gonna sign it!

7
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:12,800
In fact, George is out
with the woman from NBC now.

8
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,800
I'm afraid we're
gonna have to pass.

9
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:15,800
You're passing?

10
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,033
Well, it's much too low.

11
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:20,033
That's it for this piece
of junk. I've had it.

12
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:21,633
Is that the one
your parents gave you?

13
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:22,900
Yeah, but
it never works!

14
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:24,733
Where's that watch
we bought you? At the jeweler.

15
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:26,333
I would like somebody to hit me.

16
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:28,166
So, what's the matter
with this Davola guy?

17
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,666
He's after Jerry now.

18
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,000
You know, I never
had a back problem

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,300
You know, I never
had a back problem

20
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,333
until that night I slept
on the convertible sofa.

21
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:36,400
Cuban cigars.

22
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:37,866
It's a present from my father.

23
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,066
Here you go.

24
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,400

Yeah. Cubans.

00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,400
The Velcro.
I can't stand Velcro.

29
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:48,000
That tearing sound.

Now, listen to me.
I'm negotiating.

31
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:52,066
Negotiation.

Tell us about the trip.
How's Dr. Reston?

35
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,000
He has this power over me, okay?
I mean, he has this way

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,833
He has this power over me, okay?
I mean, he has this way

37
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:03,666
of manipulating
every little word that I say.

38
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,400
He's like a "Svenjolly."

You tell this guy
you're seeing somebody else.

That's the easiest way

His name is...

It's an entire industry

and stress organizer, Dad."

with the paperweight

as a bad gift.

There's no better way
than a paperweight

"I refuse to put any thought
into this at all."

that the papers are just blowing
right off of their desk?

61
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:56,366
What, are their desks screwed
to the back of a flatbed truck

or something?

I think she's beautiful.

she's beautiful,
