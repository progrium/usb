1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,968
See, to me,
you go to the health club,

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,970
you see all these people,
and they're working out,

3
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,138
and they're training,
and they're getting in shape,

4
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:08,306
but the strange thing is,

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:11,642
nobody's really getting
in shape for anything.

6
00:00:11,675 --> 00:00:14,844
The only reason
that you're getting in shape

7
00:00:14,877 --> 00:00:16,713
is that so you can
get through the workout.

8
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:21,082
So we're working out

9
00:00:21,116 --> 00:00:22,750
so that we'll be in shape

10
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:24,685
for when we have to do
our exercise.

11
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:27,654
This is the whole thing.

12
00:00:27,687 --> 00:00:28,988
The other thing
I don't get about it

13
00:00:29,022 --> 00:00:30,000
is why we're so careful
about locking up

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,557
is why we're so careful
about locking up

15
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,327
our dirty towels
and smelly jockstraps.

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,397
What exactly is the black
market on these disgusting
gym clothes?

17
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:43,333
I'll give my car
to any valet guy

18
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,400
in front of a restaurant

19
00:00:44,434 --> 00:00:45,568
because he's got
a short red jacket.

20
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:46,936
Hey, he must be the valet guy.

21
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:48,437
I don't even think about it.

22
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,172
But my stinking,
putrefied gym clothes?

23
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:53,173
I got one of these--
I've got one of these locks

24
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:55,075
you could put a bullet
through it and it won't open.

25
00:00:56,075 --> 00:00:57,376
That stuff is safe.

26
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:06,183
Wide open.
I was wide open underneath.

27
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:08,385
I had three inches
on that guy.

28
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:10,019
See, you two
were hogging the ball.

29
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:12,688
Me? It wasn't me.
I never even saw the ball.

30
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:13,922
All you do is dribble.

31
00:01:13,956 --> 00:01:15,257
I have to dribble.

32
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,524
If I give it to you,
you just shoot.

33
00:01:16,558 --> 00:01:17,692
You're a chucker.

34
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:19,060
Oh, I'm a chucker?

35
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:21,195
Every time you get the ball,
you shoot.

36
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:22,629
I can't believe
you called me a chucker.

37
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:23,729
No way I'm a chucker.

38
00:01:23,763 --> 00:01:25,298
I do not chuck.
Never chucked.

39
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:27,266
Never have chucked,
never will chuck.

40
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,567
No chuck!

41
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:30,301
You chuck.

42
00:01:31,602 --> 00:01:32,636
Kramer, am I a chucker?

43
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,904
Oh, you're a chucker.

44
00:01:36,073 --> 00:01:37,974
My God, I'm a chucker.

45
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:39,108
All these years
I've been chucking,

46
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,542
you never told me?

47
00:01:40,576 --> 00:01:42,143
Well, it's not an easy thing
to bring up.

48
00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:45,213
Hey, you know,

49
00:01:45,246 --> 00:01:46,814
this is the first time
we ever saw each other naked?

50
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,318
Believe me,
I didn't see anything.

51
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:53,686
Oh, you didn't sneak a peek?

52
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,088
No. Did you?

53
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:57,722
Yeah, I snuck a peek.

54
00:01:57,755 --> 00:01:58,756
Well, why?

55
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,101
Why not?

56
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:00,391
Why not?

57
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:01,758
What about you, George?

58
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,861
Oh. Yeah, I...

59
00:02:06,028 --> 00:02:07,597
snuck a peek.

60
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,464
But it was so fast,
I didn't see anything.

61
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:11,132
It was just a blur.

62
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,401
I made a conscious effort
not to look.

63
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,436
There's certain information
I just don't want to have.

64
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:17,604
Okay...

65
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,673
I got to go meet Newman.

66
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:21,773
All right, I'll see you later.

67
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:23,442
Have a good one.
All right.

68
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:25,276
Yeah.

69
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:29,101
Look at this guy.

70
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:29,779
Look at this guy.

71
00:02:29,814 --> 00:02:31,881
Does he have to
stretch in here?

72
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:35,083
You know who that is?

73
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:37,953
Who?
That's Keith Hernandez.

74
00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:39,821
Keith Hernandez,
the baseball player?

75
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:42,756
Yeah, that's him.

76
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:44,458
Are you sure?
Positive.

77
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:46,592
Wow!

78
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:48,127
Keith Hernandez!

79
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,262
He's such a great
player. Yeah.

80
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,931
He's a real smart guy too.
He's a civil war buff.

81
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,398
I'd love to be
a civil war buff.

82
00:02:57,868 --> 00:02:59,101
What do you have to do
to become a buff?

83
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:00,002
What do you have to do
to become a buff?

84
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,805
So Biff wants
to be a buff?

85
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:05,373
Well, sleeping
less than 18 hours a day

86
00:03:05,406 --> 00:03:06,507
would be a start.

87
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,309
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

88
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:11,278
You know, I only got

89
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:12,779
two weeks left
of unemployment.

90
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:13,813
I got to prove I've been
looking for a job

91
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:14,848
to get an extension.

92
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:17,616
Hey, should we say
something to him?

93
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,951
Oh, yeah,
I'm sure he loves

94
00:03:18,984 --> 00:03:20,552
to hear from fans
in the locker room.

95
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:22,887
Well, he could say
hello to me.
I wouldn't mind.

96
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:25,889
He's Keith Hernandez.

97
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:27,823
You're Jerry Seinfeld.

98
00:03:33,862 --> 00:03:37,465
So?
What, are you comparing
yourself to Keith Hernandez?

99
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:40,300
The guy's a baseball
player, Jerry, baseball!

100
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,034
I know what he is.
I recognized him.

101
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:43,302
You didn't even
notice him.

102
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:45,704
What, you're making
some wisecracks
in a nightclub?

103
00:03:45,737 --> 00:03:48,139
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo.

104
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:51,642
The guy was in game six,
two runs down! Two outs!

105
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:53,143
Facing elimination!

106
00:03:53,177 --> 00:03:54,344
Excuse me.

107
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:55,645
I don't want to
disturb you.

108
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:56,879
I'm Keith Hernandez,

109
00:03:56,912 --> 00:03:58,314
and I just want to tell you
what a big fan I am.

110
00:03:58,347 --> 00:03:59,101
I love your comedy.

111
00:03:59,101 --> 00:03:59,381
I love your comedy.

112
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:07,821
Really?
Oh, yeah, I've always
wanted to do what you do.

113
00:04:07,854 --> 00:04:09,255
Do what I do?

114
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,890
You're one of my favorite
ballplayers of all time!

115
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:11,924
Mine too.

116
00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:16,094
I love that bit
about Jimmy Olsen.

117
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:17,828
Oh, really?

118
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:19,196
Thank you.

119
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,999
You know, Keith,
what I've always
wondered is,

120
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:25,934
with all these ball clubs
flying around all season,

121
00:04:25,968 --> 00:04:27,869
wouldn't you think
there'd be a plane crash?

122
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,542
Are you performing anywhere
in New York right now?

123
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,844
At this club on
the East Side.
You should come in.

124
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,011
But think about it--

125
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:41,346
26 teams, 162 games
a season.

126
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:42,680
You would think,

127
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:45,082
eventually, an entire team
would just get wiped out.

128
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:49,953
You know, I live
on the East Side.

129
00:04:49,986 --> 00:04:51,421
I'll give you my number,

130
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:53,522
just give me a call, and tell
me whenever you want to go.

131
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:55,757
Or maybe just get together
for a cup of coffee.

132
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,425
Oh, that'd be great.

133
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,101
Well, it's only
a matter of time.

134
00:04:59,101 --> 00:04:59,227
Well, it's only
a matter of time.

135
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:02,395
Who's this chucker?

136
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,068
It's been three days,
and he hasn't called.

137
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:12,803
Well, maybe
you should call him.

138
00:05:12,837 --> 00:05:14,371
I can't. I can't.

139
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:15,772
Why not?

140
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:18,307
I don't know.
I just feel like
he should call me.

141
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:20,109
What's the difference?

142
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:22,978
You don't understand,
Elaine. I don't want
to be overanxious.

143
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:25,079
If he wants to see me,
he has my number.

144
00:05:25,112 --> 00:05:26,748
He should call.

145
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:29,101
Ugh! God, look
at this ashtray.

146
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:30,550
Ugh! God, look
at this ashtray.

147
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,286
I hate cigarettes.

148
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,887
You know, I can't
stand these guys.

149
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,988
You give
your number to them,

150
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:37,088
and then
they don't call.

151
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:39,991
Why do they do that?

152
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,259
I'm sorry, honey.

153
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:46,228
I mean, I thought
he liked me.

154
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,964
We were getting along.

155
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:49,898
He came over to me.
I didn't go over to him.

156
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:51,499
I know.
Why did he come
over to me

157
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:53,067
if he didn't want
to see me?

158
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:54,969
Here I meet this guy,
this great guy--

159
00:05:55,002 --> 00:05:56,570
Right.
This ballplayer,

160
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:58,004
the best guy I ever
met in my life.

161
00:05:58,037 --> 00:05:59,101
I know.
That's it.

162
00:05:59,101 --> 00:05:59,673
I know.
That's it.

163
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:01,440
I'm never giving
my number out
to another guy again.

164
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:03,275
You know, sometimes,

165
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:04,809
I've given my number
out to guys,

166
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:07,078
and it takes them
a month to call.

167
00:06:07,111 --> 00:06:08,412
Hah!

168
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:09,580
Good. Good.

169
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:11,147
Well, if he's calling
in a month,

170
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:12,983
he's got a prayer.

171
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,618
You know, maybe
he's been busy.

172
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:17,919
Maybe he's been
out of town.

173
00:06:17,952 --> 00:06:21,122
Oh, they don't
have phones
out of town?

174
00:06:21,155 --> 00:06:22,823
I love how people say
they're too busy.

175
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:26,093
"Too busy." Pick up
a phone!

176
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:29,101
Takes two minutes.
How can you be too busy?

177
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:29,361
Takes two minutes.
How can you be too busy?

178
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:31,096
Why don't you just
go ahead and call him?

179
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:33,464
Well, I can't call here.
It's a coffee shop.

180
00:06:33,498 --> 00:06:35,132
I mean, what am I
going to say to him?

181
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:36,701
Just ask him
if he wants
to get together.

182
00:06:38,002 --> 00:06:39,135
For what, dinner?

183
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,705
Dinner's good.

184
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:44,206
Don't you think
that's coming on
a little too strong?

185
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,374
Isn't that, like,
a turnoff?

186
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:49,243
Jerry... he's a guy.

187
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,080
I know, but
this is all very
confusing.

188
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,516
When you're in your 30s,

189
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,283
it's very hard
to make a new friend.

190
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,101
Whatever the group is
that you've got now,

191
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:00,719
Whatever the group is
that you've got now,

192
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:01,986
that's who you're going with.

193
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,321
You're not interviewing.

194
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:04,822
You're not looking
at any new people.

195
00:07:04,855 --> 00:07:07,790
You're not interested
in seeing any applications.

196
00:07:07,824 --> 00:07:10,626
They don't know the places,
they don't know the foods.

197
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:12,361
They don't know
the activities.

198
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:14,462
If I meet a guy at a club
or a gym, I'll say,

199
00:07:14,495 --> 00:07:17,632
"You're a very nice person,
full of potential.

200
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:19,466
"We're just not hiring
right now."

201
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:22,735
Of course, when you're a kid,
you can be friends
with anybody.

202
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:24,136
Do you remember?
When you're a little kid,

203
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,538
what are the qualifications?

204
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,672
If someone's
in front of my house now,

205
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:28,873
that's my friend.

206
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:29,101
They're my friend.
That's it.

207
00:07:29,101 --> 00:07:30,507
They're my friend.
That's it.

208
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,209
"Are you a grown-up? No?
"Great. Come on in!

209
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:35,645
"Let's jump up and down
on my bed!"

210
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:36,979
And if you have
anything in common at all--

211
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:38,814
"You like cherry soda?
I like cherry soda.

212
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:40,949
"We'll be best friends!"

213
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:47,887
You know, you only have
two more weeks

214
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:49,822
before your benefits
run out.

215
00:07:49,856 --> 00:07:51,323
Yes, and I was hoping,

216
00:07:51,357 --> 00:07:54,092
perhaps to get
a 13-week extension,

217
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,693
if that's possible.

218
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:58,195
So where have you been
looking for work?

219
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,030
Well, you know what
I've discovered, Mrs. Sokol?

220
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:02,165
It's not so much
the looking

221
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:03,833
as the listening.

222
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:05,734
I listen for work.

223
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:06,869
And as I'm looking

224
00:08:06,902 --> 00:08:08,170
and listening,
I'm also looking.

225
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:10,104
You cannot
discount looking.

226
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:12,045
It's sort of a
combination. It's looking...
and listening.

227
00:08:12,045 --> 00:08:12,173
It's sort of a
combination. It's looking...
and listening.

228
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:13,840
Listening... and looking.

229
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:15,742
But you must look.

230
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:18,210
Can you be specific
about any of these companies?

231
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:20,612
Specific. Uh, let's see...

232
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:22,781
I've walked in and out
of so many buildings.

233
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:24,382
They all blend in together.

234
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:26,517
Well, just give me one name.

235
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,618
One name.
Absolutely.

236
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:29,019
Uh...

237
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:30,887
Let's see, there's, uh...

238
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,054
Vandelay Industries.

239
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:33,289
I just saw them.

240
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:35,190
I got very close there.
Very close.

241
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,525
What type of company is that?

242
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,860
Latex. Latex
manufacturing,
Mrs. Sokol.

243
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,795
Mm-hmm. And you
interviewed there?

244
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:42,045
Yes, for
a sales position.

245
00:08:42,045 --> 00:08:43,162
Yes, for
a sales position.

246
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,564
Latex salesman.

247
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:48,801
The, uh, selling of latex
and latex-related products.

248
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:51,869
They just wouldn't
give me a chance.

249
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:53,370
Damn it!

250
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:55,539
Now, I'm going to need
an address and a phone number

251
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:58,108
for this, uh,
Vandelay company.

252
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:59,775
You like gum?

253
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,877
Because I have a friend
in the gum business.

254
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:03,278
I've got a gum guy.

255
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:05,246
I make one phone call,
I have boxes of gum

256
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,480
delivered right
to your door.

257
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:07,815
The address?

258
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,649
Ahem.

259
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,817
(As Jose Jimenez)
The address is...

260
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,422
Jose Jimenez.
Do you recognize that?

261
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:18,556
No.

262
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:19,857
(As Jimenez)
Jose Jimenez.

263
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:22,993
Very funny.

264
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:24,261
(In Normal Voice)
Really, he's very funny.

265
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:25,662
The address.

266
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:30,398
Uh... uh, Vandelay
is, um...

267
00:09:30,432 --> 00:09:32,767
129 West 81st Street.

268
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,268
It's a very
small industry.

269
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:36,503
It's one of the reasons
I wanted to work for them.

270
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:38,504
The phone number.

271
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:42,045
That's, uh, KL5... 8383.

272
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:42,507
That's, uh, KL5... 8383.

273
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,109
Are you planning on
calling them soon?

274
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:46,244
Because they have
very strange hours.

275
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:47,678
As soon as I'm
done with you.

276
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,647
Well, um...

277
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:53,249
You know what?
I'll check in
with you next week.

278
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:54,751
I got to run now
because I have--

279
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:56,085
(Chuckling Uneasily)

280
00:09:56,118 --> 00:09:57,619
I've got a full plate
this afternoon.

281
00:09:57,653 --> 00:09:58,787
Okay.
All right.

282
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,355
Really good to--
to, uh...

283
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:08,261
He'll call you back!

284
00:10:08,294 --> 00:10:09,928
It's a par 5.

285
00:10:09,962 --> 00:10:11,596
So, you know,
I step up to the tee,

286
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:12,045
and I hit a beautiful drive

287
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,765
and I hit a beautiful drive

288
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:15,432
right down the middle
of the fairway.

289
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:18,301
I mean, you know
my hook, right?
Elaine?

290
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:20,070
How about this shirt?
Is this okay?

291
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:27,709
Jerry, he's a guy.

292
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,779
Well, it's a dogleg left,
so I play the hook, right?

293
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:34,414
Well, hold on.
There's another call.

294
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:37,483
Jerry! Jerry!

295
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:39,317
George?
<i>Kramer, put Jerry</i>
<i>on the phone!</i>

296
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,819
Yeah, look,
I'm in the middle
of something.

297
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:42,045
Call back.
<i>Kramer! No--</i>

298
00:10:42,045 --> 00:10:42,187
Call back.
<i>Kramer! No--</i>

299
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:45,989
So, the ball takes off.
I'm waiting for it to turn.

300
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:54,996
Would you--

301
00:10:57,331 --> 00:10:59,400
All right.
Well, I'll talk
to Jerry. Yeah.

302
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,902
Hey, you know,
that was Michael
and Carol.

303
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:04,136
She's wondering
when we're gonna come over

304
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:05,237
and see the baby.

305
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,472
Oh, see the baby.
Again with the baby.

306
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:08,973
Who are they?

307
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:10,141
Ah, this guy
who used to live
in the building

308
00:11:10,174 --> 00:11:11,742
that keeps calling us
to see the baby.

309
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:12,045
"You gotta see the baby."

310
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:13,343
"You gotta see the baby."

311
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,212
"When are you
gonna see the baby?"

312
00:11:15,245 --> 00:11:16,813
Can't they just
send us a tape?

313
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:18,480
You know, maybe
if you wait a few
more months,

314
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:19,915
it won't be
a baby anymore,

315
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:21,249
then you won't
have to see it.

316
00:11:21,282 --> 00:11:22,517
Uh-huh, because
he'll be all grown-up.

317
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,718
Yeah.
Yeah. Hah.

318
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,687
Hey, Kramer,
what do you think
of this shirt?

319
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,659
I don't know.
It's too busy.

320
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:36,394
It looks like
you're trying too hard

321
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:37,528
to make an impression
on him.

322
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:39,030
You're not
being yourself.

323
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:42,045
What guy?
I know he's just a guy,
but I really like him.

324
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:42,532
What guy?
I know he's just a guy,
but I really like him.

325
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,435
Who are you
talking about?

326
00:11:46,468 --> 00:11:49,170
Uh, Keith, uh, Hernandez.

327
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:50,905
Keith Hernandez?

328
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,240
Keith Hernandez!

329
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:57,009
Do me a favor,
would you?

330
00:11:57,043 --> 00:11:58,610
Would you change lanes?
Would you get
out of this lane?

331
00:11:58,644 --> 00:11:59,845
You gotta
get out of this lane.

332
00:11:59,878 --> 00:12:01,012
This lane stinks.
They're all double-parked.

333
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:02,948
Get out of this lane,
I'm begging you.

334
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,615
Please. Please!

335
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:11,354
You know what?

336
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:12,045
Bad mistake. My mistake.

337
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:13,121
Bad mistake. My mistake.

338
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:14,389
Do me a favor.
Go back to the other lane.

339
00:12:14,422 --> 00:12:15,858
Your lane was better.
Forget this lane.

340
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:17,192
This lane stinks.
Go back to your lane.

341
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:18,893
Go ahead. Bad mistake.

342
00:12:18,926 --> 00:12:19,961
Go! Go! Go!

343
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:21,228
Make this light!
Make this light!

344
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,295
Oh...

345
00:12:23,063 --> 00:12:24,597
That's it! Get out!

346
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,698
What do you mean,
get out?

347
00:12:25,731 --> 00:12:27,099
Get out of the cab!

348
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:28,933
What? I'm not getting
out of this cab!

349
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,435
No! No!

350
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:32,036
You cannot throw me out!

351
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,237
No! Get... get...

352
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:36,639
Hello, Newman.

353
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,875
I hate Keith
Hernandez. Hate him!

354
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:40,409
I despise him.

355
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:42,045
Why?

356
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:42,378
Why?

357
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:43,411
Why? I'll tell you why.

358
00:12:43,444 --> 00:12:44,545
No, let me tell.

359
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:45,713
You can't tell it.
You always tell it.

360
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:47,347
All right, tell it.
You just tell it.

361
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,919
June 14, 1987.
Mets-Phillies.

362
00:12:53,952 --> 00:12:55,454
We're enjoying
a beautiful afternoon

363
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:56,822
in the right-field
stands

364
00:12:56,855 --> 00:12:58,390
when a crucial
Hernandez error

365
00:12:58,423 --> 00:12:59,624
opens the door

366
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:01,092
to a five-run
Phillies' ninth.

367
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,093
Costs the Mets
the game.

368
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:04,861
Our day was ruined.

369
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:07,397
There was a lot
of people, you know,

370
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,564
they were waiting
by the players' parking lot.

371
00:13:09,598 --> 00:13:11,165
Now, we're coming
down the ramp.

372
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:12,045
<i>Newman was</i>
<i>in front of me.</i>

373
00:13:12,045 --> 00:13:13,134
<i>Newman was</i>
<i>in front of me.</i>

374
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,168
<i>Hernandez</i>
<i>was coming toward us.</i>

375
00:13:15,202 --> 00:13:17,737
As he passes us,
Newman turns and says,

376
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,706
<i>"Nice game,</i>
<i>pretty boy."</i>

377
00:13:23,108 --> 00:13:25,443
<i>Hernandez</i>
<i>continued past us</i>
<i>up the ramp.</i>

378
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:28,278
Then, a second later,
something happened...

379
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:30,147
that changed us

380
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,849
in a very deep
and profound way

381
00:13:32,882 --> 00:13:34,783
from that day forward.

382
00:13:34,817 --> 00:13:35,918
What was it?

383
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:37,519
He spit on us.

384
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:40,655
<i>And I screamed out,</i>
<i>"I'm hit!"</i>

385
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,125
Then I turned,

386
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,826
<i>and the spit</i>
<i>ricocheted off him,</i>

387
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,461
<i>and it hit me.</i>

388
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,764
Wow. What a story.

389
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:53,998
Yeah, unfortunately,

390
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:55,199
the immutable
laws of physics

391
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:56,500
contradict
the whole premise

392
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,268
of your account.

393
00:13:58,301 --> 00:13:59,436
Allow me
to reconstruct this,

394
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:00,870
if I may,
for Ms. Benes,

395
00:14:00,903 --> 00:14:03,839
as I've heard this story
a number of times.

396
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:06,141
Newman, Kramer,
if you'll indulge me.

397
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:09,477
According to your story,

398
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,045
<i>Hernandez passes you</i>
<i>and starts walking</i>
<i>up the ramp.</i>

399
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:12,446
<i>Hernandez passes you</i>
<i>and starts walking</i>
<i>up the ramp.</i>

400
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,448
Mm-hmm.
Then you say
you were struck...

401
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:18,450
On the right temple.

402
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:22,186
The spit then proceeds
to ricochet off the temple,

403
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:23,988
striking Newman
between the third

404
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:25,656
<i>and the fourth rib.</i>

405
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,825
The spit then
came off the rib,

406
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:31,126
made a right turn,

407
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,994
hitting Newman
in the right wrist...

408
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:37,398
causing him
to drop his baseball cap.

409
00:14:39,032 --> 00:14:41,701
The spit then
splashed off the wrist,

410
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:42,045
pauses--
in midair, mind you...

411
00:14:42,045 --> 00:14:44,370
pauses--
in midair, mind you...

412
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:47,538
makes a left turn,

413
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:50,941
and lands on
Newman's left thigh.

414
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:54,878
That is one
magic loogie.

415
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:06,820
Well, that's
the way it happened.

416
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:09,489
What happened
to your head
when you got hit?

417
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:11,256
Well, uh...
uh, my head

418
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,045
<i>went back,</i>
<i>to the left.</i>

419
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,358
<i>went back,</i>
<i>to the left.</i>

420
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:14,659
Say that again.

421
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:15,927
KRAMER: <i>Back</i>
<i>and to the left.</i>

422
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:18,729
Back and
to the left.

423
00:15:19,863 --> 00:15:21,098
JERRY: <i>Back...</i>

424
00:15:21,131 --> 00:15:22,732
and to the left.

425
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,234
So what are
you saying?

426
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:29,570
I'm saying that
the spit could not have
come from behind,

427
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:33,707
that there had
to have been
a second spitter...

428
00:15:42,214 --> 00:15:45,182
<i>Behind the bushes,</i>
<i>on the gravelly road.</i>

429
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:47,618
If the spitter was
behind you, as you claim,

430
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:49,285
that would've
caused your head

431
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:52,187
to pitch forward.

432
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:56,458
So the spit could've
only come from the
front and to the right.

433
00:15:56,491 --> 00:15:58,592
But that's not
what they would
have you believe.

434
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:01,729
I'm leaving.

435
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:03,896
Jerry's a nut.

436
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,099
Wait, wait, wait.

437
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,601
The sad thing is,
we may never know
the real truth.

438
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:14,905
(Wheezing)

439
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:17,541
(Coughing)

440
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:19,908
Did anybody call
here asking for
Vandelay Industries?

441
00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:21,377
No. What happened to you?

442
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,211
All right, listen closely.

443
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:24,446
I was at the
unemployment office,

444
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,281
and I told them
I was very close

445
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:28,982
to getting a job
with Vandelay Industries,

446
00:16:29,015 --> 00:16:30,651
and I gave them
your phone number.

447
00:16:30,684 --> 00:16:32,152
So now when
the phone rings,

448
00:16:32,185 --> 00:16:34,787
you have to answer,
"Vandelay Industries."

449
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,888
I'm Vandelay Industries?

450
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:37,322
Right.

451
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:38,422
And what is that?

452
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,757
You're in latex.

453
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,259
Latex?
Right.

454
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,045
And what do I do
with latex?

455
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:42,726
And what do I do
with latex?

456
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,561
I don't know!
You manufacture it.

457
00:16:44,594 --> 00:16:47,229
Right here, in this
little apartment?

458
00:16:47,263 --> 00:16:48,797
And what do I say
about you?

459
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,632
You're considering hiring me
for your latex salesman.

460
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,834
I'm gonna hire you
as my latex salesman?

461
00:16:53,868 --> 00:16:54,969
Right.

462
00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:56,136
I don't think so.

463
00:16:58,338 --> 00:17:00,606
Why would I do that?

464
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,641
Because I asked you to.

465
00:17:02,675 --> 00:17:04,342
Well, if you think
I'm looking for someone

466
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:05,743
to just sit at a desk,

467
00:17:05,777 --> 00:17:07,111
pushing papers around,

468
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:08,845
you can forget it.

469
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,946
I've got enough headaches

470
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,515
just trying
to manufacture the stuff.

Where are you going?

477
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:24,124
They're giving me
a ride downtown.

478
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:25,492
You know, there
had to have been

479
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:27,259
a second spitter,
but who was it?

480
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:28,594
Who had the motive?

481
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:30,096
That's what I've been
trying to figure out

482

the past five years.

483
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,731
What the hell
are you two talking about?

was really fun. Thanks.

the woman we gave a ride
to earlier tonight...

505
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,302
Elaine.
Yeah.

506
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,470
What's her story?

507
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,739
Oh, I don't know.
We used to go out.

508
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,506
Would you mind
if I gave her a call?

509
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:31,242
For a date?
Yeah.

Go ahead.

00:19:02,031 --> 00:19:03,366
Yeah?

521
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:05,234
<i>It's Elaine.</i>
Come on up.

522
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:06,835
So then what?

523
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:08,570
Uh, nothing.
Then he took me home.

524
00:19:09,571 --> 00:19:11,472
Did you shake his hand?

525
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:14,174
Yeah.

526
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:15,416
What kind of a shake
does he have?

527
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,509
What kind of a shake
does he have?

528
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:18,211
Good shake. Perfect shake.

529
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:20,279
Single pump, not too hard.

530
00:19:20,312 --> 00:19:22,347
Didn't have to prove anything,

531
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:24,048
but, you know, firm enough
to know he was there.

532
00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:26,950
So, uh...

533
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:28,385
you gonna see him again?

534
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,122
He asked me if I was
doing anything Friday night.

535
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:35,491
Wow! The weekend.

536
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:40,260
So then, as I was getting out
of the car--

537
00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:41,428
Hi!

538
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:43,297
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Hi, Elaine.

539
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,530
So...

540
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:45,416
How was your date?

541
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:45,898
How was your date?

542
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:49,567
What date?
It's a guy.

543
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:50,935
So, you know, uh,

544
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:52,403
he called me.

545
00:19:52,436 --> 00:19:53,537
Already?

546
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,571
Keith called you?

547
00:19:56,472 --> 00:19:58,741
Huh. This guy
really gets around.

548
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:03,044
Do you mind?

549
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,179
No, not at all.
Why should I mind?

550
00:20:06,447 --> 00:20:08,382
What did he say?

551
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,150
He asked me out
for Saturday night.

552
00:20:10,183 --> 00:20:11,484
You going?

553
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:13,152
No, I told him
I was busy.

554
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:14,753
Oh, really?

555
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:15,416
So we're going
out Friday.

556
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,455
So we're going
out Friday.

557
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:24,828
Friday?
Yeah.

558
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:27,463
He's going out
with you on Friday?

559
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:29,431
Yeah.

560
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:31,166
He's supposed
to see me on Friday.

561
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,135
Oh. I didn't know.

562
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:35,636
We made plans!

563
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,771
Well, I-- I'll cancel it.

564
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:39,439
No, don't cancel it.

565
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:43,575
Huh. Well, this is a little...
awkward, isn't it?

566
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:45,416
Well, frankly, it is.

567
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:45,444
Well, frankly, it is.

568
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:49,613
I've never seen you
jealous before.

569
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:50,948
Well, you're not
even a fan.

570
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:53,616
I was at game six.
You didn't even watch it.

571
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,451
Wait a second.
Wait a minute.

572
00:20:55,484 --> 00:20:57,286
Are you jealous of him
or are you jealous of me?

573
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:08,294
Any Hennigans
around here?

574
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:10,128
(Telephone Ringing)

575
00:21:14,632 --> 00:21:15,416
Vandelay Industries.

576
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,367
Vandelay Industries.

577
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:20,236
Kal Varnsen speaking.

578
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:24,306
May we help you?

579
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:25,607
Oh, hi, Keith.

580
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,976
No, I was just
joking around.

581
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:29,810
No. No, I don't
mind at all.

582
00:21:29,843 --> 00:21:31,178
(Whispering) No, no, no!
I can cancel.

583
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:33,280
Sure, we'll do
something next week.
I can--

584
00:21:33,313 --> 00:21:34,681
No, it's no
problem at all.

585
00:21:34,714 --> 00:21:35,815
I--

586
00:21:35,848 --> 00:21:37,849
Okay. Take it easy.

587
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:39,150
That was Keith.

588
00:21:39,184 --> 00:21:40,551
We're gonna do
something next week.

589
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:43,454
Hey, what are you
doing Friday night?

590
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:45,416
Friday night?
Nothing... now.

591
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,890
Friday night?
Nothing... now.

592
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:48,825
Okay, you want
to come with me
and see the baby?

593
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:50,559
Oh, fasten your
seat belts.

594
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:53,395
We're going to see
the baby.

595
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:55,963
If you don't see the baby now,
you're never gonna see her.

596
00:21:55,997 --> 00:21:57,398
All right, I'll go.

597
00:21:57,431 --> 00:21:58,832
All right.

598
00:22:10,508 --> 00:22:11,709
(Telephone Rings)

599
00:22:11,742 --> 00:22:13,410
I'll get that.

600
00:22:13,844 --> 00:22:15,011
Yello.

601
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:17,880
What-delay Industries?

602
00:22:17,914 --> 00:22:19,081
No!

603
00:22:19,115 --> 00:22:20,649
GEORGE: Vandelay!
Say Vandelay!

604
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:23,351
No, you're way,
way, way off.

605
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:24,685
Well, yeah, yeah,
that's the right number,

606
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,320
but this is an apartment.

607
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:27,687
No, say--
Vandelay! Say--

608
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:31,424
Vandelay Industries!

609
00:22:31,457 --> 00:22:33,726
Yeah, no problem,
no problem.

610
00:22:36,928 --> 00:22:39,030
(Sobbing)

611
00:22:39,063 --> 00:22:40,864
How did you know
who they wanted?

612
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:52,140
And you want to be
my latex salesman?

613
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,547
Just sign here, please.

614
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,914
I know who it was too.

615
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,515
It was the guy
that interviewed me.

616
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,250
He was very threatened by me.

617
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:07,517
I mean, why else
wouldn't he hire me?

618
00:23:07,551 --> 00:23:09,453
I could sell latex like that.

619
00:23:09,486 --> 00:23:11,087
Just sign that.

620
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,794
Ahem.

621
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:21,695
Who is, uh, this?

622
00:23:21,728 --> 00:23:23,696
It's my daughter.

623
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,731
This is your daughter?

624
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:27,933
My God!

625
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:31,202
My God!

626
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:34,237
I hope you don't
mind my saying,
she is breathtaking.

627
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:37,974
You think so?

628
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:41,377
Would you take
this picture away
from me?

629
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,645
Just take it away
and get it out of here.

630
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,113
Take it away
and put it away.

631
00:23:45,146 --> 00:23:45,416
Let me just
sign this and go.

632
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:47,548
Let me just
sign this and go.

633
00:23:47,582 --> 00:23:50,750
You know, she doesn't
even have a boyfriend.

634
00:23:51,918 --> 00:23:54,253
Okay. O-- Okay.

635
00:23:54,287 --> 00:23:55,954
Who do you think
you're talking to?

636
00:23:55,988 --> 00:23:58,256
What are you,
you trying to make
a joke, Mrs. Sokol?

637
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,191
Because it's not funny.
I can tell you that.

638
00:24:01,092 --> 00:24:03,226
I'm serious. She doesn't.

639
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:06,262
You know, it's
one thing to not give
me the extension,

640
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:08,964
but to tease
and to torture
me like this,

641
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:11,900
there's no call
for that.

642
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:14,468
Would you like
her phone number?

643
00:24:17,437 --> 00:24:20,172
Mrs. Sokol, I-- I--
I don't know what to say.

644
00:24:20,206 --> 00:24:22,108
I-- I-- Where should
I sign this thing?

645
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:23,875
No, no, no, no, no.

646
00:24:24,776 --> 00:24:26,344
Don't worry about it.

647
00:24:26,377 --> 00:24:27,845
Oh...

648
00:24:27,878 --> 00:24:29,413
Unemployment,
it's a tough thing,

649
00:24:29,446 --> 00:24:32,582
even if you get a job
after you've been unemployed,

650
00:24:32,616 --> 00:24:36,084
they take unemployment
out of your check every week

651
00:24:36,118 --> 00:24:37,820
and show it to you
in that little box.

652
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:41,488
How good can it be
for your confidence

653
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,757
that every paycheck you get

654
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,416
has the word
"unemployment" on it?

655
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:45,959
has the word
"unemployment" on it?

656
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,961
You can't get it
out of your mind.

657
00:24:48,994 --> 00:24:50,462
You just got the job.

658
00:24:50,495 --> 00:24:52,631
They're already getting ready
for you to be laid off.

659
00:24:52,664 --> 00:24:54,532
I have a friend
who's unemployed.

660
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:56,534
He's collecting
unemployment insurance.

661
00:24:56,567 --> 00:25:00,437
This guy has never worked
this hard in his life

662
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,272
to keep this thing going.

663
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:06,641
He's down there every week
waiting on the lines,

664
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:08,276
and getting interviewed,

665
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:10,978
and making up all these lies
about looking for jobs.

666
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:14,147
If they had any idea
the effort and energy

667
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,416
that he is expending
to avoid work,

668
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:18,016
that he is expending
to avoid work,

669
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,351
I'm sure
they'd give him a raise.

670
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:20,785
I'm sure of it.

671
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:24,055
The guy is doing
a tremendous job not working.

672
00:25:27,657 --> 00:25:30,025
So tell me more
about this game six.

673
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,327
Well, there was two outs,
bottom of the 10th.

674
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:33,495
Yeah.

675
00:25:33,528 --> 00:25:35,129
We're one out away
from losing the series.

676
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:36,397
Ooh...

677
00:25:39,432 --> 00:25:41,401
Ooh! Kootchie, kootchie,
kootchie-koo.

678
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,371
Hello. How
are you?

679
00:25:47,706 --> 00:25:49,674
So what do
you think?

680
00:25:50,575 --> 00:25:52,376
Do you love her?

681
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:54,178
Yes, I do love her.

682
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:58,814
You have
a very nice
place here.

683
00:25:58,847 --> 00:26:01,016
So who do
you think
she looks like?

684
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:02,284
Lyndon Johnson.

685
00:26:03,551 --> 00:26:06,153
What? Lyndon Johnson?

686
00:26:06,187 --> 00:26:07,588
He's joking.

687
00:26:07,621 --> 00:26:08,654
No. I'm not joking.

688
00:26:08,688 --> 00:26:10,990
She looks like
Lyndon Johnson.

689
00:26:11,023 --> 00:26:12,825
Jerry, I can't believe

690
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:14,826
it took you so long
to see the baby.

691
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:15,416
I kept saying
to Michael,

692
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:15,994
I kept saying
to Michael,

693
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:18,362
"When is Jerry
going to see the baby?"

694
00:26:18,396 --> 00:26:19,797
I was saying
the same thing.

695
00:26:20,598 --> 00:26:21,731
Let's take
a picture.

696
00:26:21,764 --> 00:26:22,832
Michael, get
the camera.

697
00:26:22,865 --> 00:26:24,066
You don't have
to take a picture.

698
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,368
I don't know
where it is.

699
00:26:26,402 --> 00:26:28,970
It's in the
bottom drawer
of our dresser.

700
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:30,771
Hurry up!

701
00:26:32,372 --> 00:26:33,774
He's such an idiot.

702
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:36,876
Jerry,

703
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,677
you want to pick her up?

704
00:26:38,711 --> 00:26:40,446
I'd better not.
I'll pick her up.

705
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:43,181
GEORGE (Screaming):
<i>No!</i>

706
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:45,416
Thank you for
a wonderful time,
George.

707
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:46,217
Thank you for
a wonderful time,
George.

708
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,684
Glad you enjoyed it.

709
00:26:47,718 --> 00:26:50,286
I haven't had a Big Mac
in a long time.

710
00:26:51,387 --> 00:26:53,288
Billions and billions.

711
00:26:54,556 --> 00:26:56,291
Would you like
to come up?

712
00:26:57,726 --> 00:26:59,693
Would I like
to come up?

713
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:02,429
I would love
to come up.

714
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:04,464
I'm-- I'm fighting
not to.

715
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,932
Fighting.

716
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:08,300
Unfortunately,

717
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:11,069
I, uh, have to get
an early start tomorrow.

718
00:27:11,102 --> 00:27:13,638
Got to get up
and hit that pavement.

719
00:27:13,671 --> 00:27:15,416
But it's Saturday.
All the offices are closed.

720
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,173
But it's Saturday.
All the offices are closed.

721
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:19,508
I got me an appointment
with a hardware store.

722
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:22,044
I'm not saying
I want to do it

723
00:27:22,077 --> 00:27:23,378
for the rest
of my life,

724
00:27:23,411 --> 00:27:25,547
but hardware
fascinates me.

725
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,281
Wouldn't you love
to make a key?

726
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,985
Will you call me
as soon as you get home?

727
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:38,056
Tonight?
Yes.

728
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,590
Will I call you
when I get home?

729
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:43,060
What do you think?

730
00:27:43,093 --> 00:27:44,561
(Snorts)
You kill me.

731
00:27:44,594 --> 00:27:45,416
You really kill me.

732
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:46,328
You really kill me.

733
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,165
Well, good night.

734
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,404
It was an accident.
Right, Jerry?

735
00:27:57,437 --> 00:27:59,005
It was an accident.

736
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:00,706
Aw, she's gonna be
all right.

737
00:28:02,675 --> 00:28:05,277
(Squeaky Voice) Here,
baby. Here.
Here, baby.

738
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,412
Baby, baby, baby.
Oh, the baby.

739
00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:10,381
My friend's got a baby.

740
00:28:11,448 --> 00:28:13,649
Got to see the baby.

741
00:28:13,683 --> 00:28:15,416
You've got to come over
and see the baby.

742
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:16,618
You've got to come over
and see the baby.

743
00:28:19,454 --> 00:28:20,755
Nobody ever wants
you to come over

744
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:23,123
and see their
grandfather, do they?

745
00:28:23,156 --> 00:28:24,825
"You've got to see
my grandfather.

746
00:28:24,858 --> 00:28:26,326
"You've got to see him.

747
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:32,097
"He's so cute.
168 pounds, four ounces!

748
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,932
"I love them
when they're this age.

749
00:28:33,965 --> 00:28:35,933
"He's 1,000 months."

750
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:37,534
You know, the mid-80s

751
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:39,436
is such a good time
for the grandpeople.

752
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:41,770
The mid-80s--
you got to see them.

753
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,739
"He went to the bathroom
by himself today."

754
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,375
You know, what's tough
about seeing people

755
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,977
when they have a baby

756
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:53,213
is that you have to match
their level of enthusiasm.

757
00:28:53,246 --> 00:28:55,381
You know what I mean?
They're always so excited.

758
00:28:55,415 --> 00:28:57,316
"What do you think of him?
What do you think?"

759
00:28:57,349 --> 00:28:59,284
Just once, I'd like to meet
a couple that goes,

760
00:28:59,318 --> 00:29:02,820
"You know, we're
not that happy with
him, frankly.

761
00:29:02,853 --> 00:29:04,121
"I think we really made
a big mistake.

762
00:29:04,154 --> 00:29:06,623
"We should have
got an aquarium.

763
00:29:06,656 --> 00:29:07,657
"You want him?
We don't even want him.

764
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,725
"You want him?"

765
00:29:12,027 --> 00:29:13,194
Thanks for
a nice evening.

766
00:29:13,228 --> 00:29:15,130
This was really fun.

767
00:29:15,163 --> 00:29:15,416
Yeah, it was.

768
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:17,632
Yeah, it was.

769
00:29:17,665 --> 00:29:19,899
KEITH'S VOICE: <i>Gosh,</i>
<i>should I kiss</i>
<i>her good night?</i>

770
00:29:21,668 --> 00:29:23,202
Elaine's VOICE:
<i>Is he going to try</i>
<i>and kiss me?</i>

771
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,172
I love Cajun cooking.

772
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:29,807
Really?
You know, my mom's
one-quarter Cajun.

773
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:32,109
Oh, my father's
half-drunk.

774
00:29:35,711 --> 00:29:37,580
Maybe they should
get together.

775
00:29:39,014 --> 00:29:40,715
<i>Go ahead. Kiss her.</i>

776
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:42,851
<i>I'm a baseball</i>
<i>player, damn it.</i>

777
00:29:44,018 --> 00:29:45,416
<i>What's he waiting for?</i>

778
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:45,853
<i>What's he waiting for?</i>

779
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:47,354
<i>I thought</i>
<i>he was a cool guy.</i>

780
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:52,058
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>I won the MVP in '79.</i>

781
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,359
<i>I can do</i>
<i>whatever I want to.</i>

782
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,895
<i>Well, this</i>
<i>is getting awkward.</i>

783
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,698
Well, good night.

784
00:30:02,632 --> 00:30:04,033
Good night.

785
00:30:09,704 --> 00:30:11,438
<i>Who does this guy</i>
<i>think he is?</i>

786
00:30:12,273 --> 00:30:13,707
<i>I'm Keith Hernandez.</i>

787
00:30:15,742 --> 00:30:17,710
Uh, who else?

788
00:30:18,211 --> 00:30:20,345
Um, Mookie.

789
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:21,380
Mookie was there.

790
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:23,047
You know him?

791
00:30:23,815 --> 00:30:25,583
Well, I don't know him.

792
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,184
I know who he is.

793
00:30:27,217 --> 00:30:29,852
Hmm. He's such
a great guy. You
should meet him.

794
00:30:29,886 --> 00:30:31,454
You know, he's the one
who got that hit--

795
00:30:31,488 --> 00:30:33,422
I know! He got the hit
in game six!

796
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:37,925
So then what happened?

797
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:40,327
Nothing. Then he
took me home.

798
00:30:41,461 --> 00:30:43,263
So did you two, uh...

799
00:30:46,232 --> 00:30:47,600
have, uh...

800
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:50,068
What?

801
00:30:51,836 --> 00:30:53,104
You know.

802
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:55,739
Milk?

803
00:30:58,641 --> 00:30:59,675
No.

804
00:31:00,242 --> 00:31:01,510
Cookies?

805
00:31:03,245 --> 00:31:04,779
Did he kiss you
good night?

806
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,814
I don't know.

807
00:31:08,181 --> 00:31:10,717
Well, what do you mean,
you don't know?

808
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,053
All right.
He kissed me, okay?

809
00:31:14,086 --> 00:31:15,416
What kind of a kiss?

810
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:15,821
What kind of a kiss?

811
00:31:15,854 --> 00:31:18,223
Was it a peck,
was it a kiss,

812
00:31:18,256 --> 00:31:20,891
was it a long
make-out thing?

813
00:31:20,925 --> 00:31:22,626
Between a peck
and a make-out.

814
00:31:24,428 --> 00:31:26,830
So you like him.

815
00:31:26,863 --> 00:31:29,264
I don't understand.
Before, you were
jealous of me.

816
00:31:29,297 --> 00:31:30,899
Now you're jealous
of him?

817
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:32,934
I'm jealous
of everybody.

818
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:37,337
(Telephone Ringing)

819
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,640
Hello.

820
00:31:40,673 --> 00:31:41,874
Oh, hi.
What's happening?

821
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,310
What?

822
00:31:45,344 --> 00:31:45,416
Oh, um... Uh.

823
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:46,811
Oh, um... Uh.

824
00:31:48,446 --> 00:31:49,980
Sure.

825
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:52,782
Um... yeah, okay.

826
00:31:52,815 --> 00:31:55,751
Then I'll see you then.

827
00:31:55,784 --> 00:31:57,719
Yeah, yeah.
Okay. Bye.

828
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,421
Who was that?

829
00:32:00,455 --> 00:32:02,590
That was Keith.

830
00:32:02,623 --> 00:32:03,758
What's going on?

831
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:05,959
He wants me
to help him move.

832
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,561
Help him move?

833
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:11,096
Move what?

834
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:12,864
You know, furniture.

835
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:15,416
So what did you say?

836
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:17,301
So what did you say?

837
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:19,836
I said yes,
but I don't feel
right about it.

838
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,171
I mean,
I hardly know the guy.

839
00:32:22,204 --> 00:32:24,639
That's a big step
in a male relationship.

840
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,341
The biggest.

841
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:28,476
That's like going
all the way.

842
00:32:31,078 --> 00:32:33,680
And you feel
you're not really
ready for...

843
00:32:33,713 --> 00:32:35,782
Well, we went
out one time.

844
00:32:35,815 --> 00:32:38,184
Don't you think
that's coming on
a little too strong?

845
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:40,685
Hey.

846
00:32:43,488 --> 00:32:45,416
What's going on?

847
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:45,622
What's going on?

848
00:32:45,655 --> 00:32:47,824
Keith Hernandez
just asked me
to help him move.

849
00:32:48,491 --> 00:32:50,459
What?

850
00:32:50,493 --> 00:32:52,895
Well, you hardly
know the guy.

851
00:32:55,697 --> 00:32:57,865
What a nerve.

852
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:00,066
You see?
Wasn't I right
about this guy?

853
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,367
Didn't I tell you?

854
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:03,336
You're not
gonna do it,
are you?

855
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:05,637
I said yes.

856
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,872
You said yes?

857
00:33:07,906 --> 00:33:11,142
Don't you have any pride
or self-respect?

858
00:33:11,175 --> 00:33:14,244
I mean, how can
you prostitute
yourself like this?

859
00:33:14,277 --> 00:33:15,416
You gonna start
driving him
to the airport?

860
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:17,146
You gonna start
driving him
to the airport?

861
00:33:17,179 --> 00:33:19,148
I'm not driving him
to the airport.

862
00:33:19,181 --> 00:33:20,382
Oh, boy.

863
00:33:21,382 --> 00:33:22,984
Hey, Kramer,
do me a favor,
would you?

864
00:33:23,018 --> 00:33:24,051
What?

865
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:25,552
Don't mention
it to anybody.

866
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,254
I wish you never
mentioned it to me.

867
00:33:39,563 --> 00:33:42,165
I had a great time
tonight, Carrie,

868
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:44,600
and I will call you
as soon as I get home.

869
00:33:44,634 --> 00:33:47,036
Don't bother.

870
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:48,937
Bother?
What kind of bother?

871
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,705
I would prefer it
if you didn't.

872
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:52,906
Why? Is anything wrong?

873
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,074
It's over, buddy.

874
00:33:54,107 --> 00:33:55,842
Done. Finished.

875
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:57,377
So long. Goodbye.

876
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,045
<i>Adios. Sayonara.</i>

877
00:34:00,712 --> 00:34:01,747
Why?

878
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,081
I've been
thinking about it.

879
00:34:03,114 --> 00:34:04,513
You got no job,
you got no prospects.

880
00:34:04,513 --> 00:34:05,516
You got no job,
you got no prospects.

881
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,417
You're like Biff Loman.

882
00:34:09,553 --> 00:34:11,687
I went to the
hardware store
interview.

883
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,422
You think I'm gonna spend
my life with somebody

884
00:34:13,456 --> 00:34:16,424
because he can get me
a deal on a box of nails?

885
00:34:18,393 --> 00:34:20,527
I thought we
were a team.

886
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,729
If I ever need a drill
bit, I'll call you.

887
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:24,464
Carrie!

888
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:25,765
Could you do me a favor?

889
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:27,667
Could you not mention
this to your mother?

890
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,303
You know,
I hate to brag,

891
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,513
but I did win
11 straight
Gold Gloves.

892
00:34:34,513 --> 00:34:36,874
but I did win
11 straight
Gold Gloves.

893
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:38,908
I wouldn't have brought
it up, but since
you mentioned it.

894
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:40,910
I didn't mention it.

895
00:34:42,478 --> 00:34:45,046
Well, I won them anyway.

896
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,114
Well, so what?

897
00:34:46,147 --> 00:34:49,716
I mean, you
played first base.

898
00:34:49,749 --> 00:34:52,385
I mean, they always
put the worst player
at first base.

899
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:54,420
That's where they
put me, and I stunk.

900
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:58,423
Elaine, you don't know
the first thing

901
00:34:58,456 --> 00:35:01,125
about first base.

902
00:35:01,158 --> 00:35:03,660
Well, I know
something about
getting to first base,

903
00:35:04,761 --> 00:35:06,529
and I know
you'll never be there.

904
00:35:07,997 --> 00:35:10,065
The way I figure it,
I've already been there,

905
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:13,201
and I plan on rounding
second tonight at
around 11:00.

906
00:35:14,935 --> 00:35:16,403
Well, uh,

907
00:35:16,436 --> 00:35:18,838
I'd watch the
third-base coach
if I were you,

908
00:35:18,871 --> 00:35:21,107
because I don't think
he's waving you in.

909
00:35:25,811 --> 00:35:27,112
You know,
I hate to say this,

910
00:35:27,145 --> 00:35:30,347
but, um, I really think
that we're hitting it off.

911
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:32,749
Get it? Get it?

912
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:33,983
Clever.

913
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:38,586
What are you doing?

914
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,921
What's that?

915
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:41,188
You smoke?

916
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,157
Yeah.

917
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,691
I didn't know
you smoked.

918
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:48,194
Is that a problem?

919
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:49,995
Uh...

920
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:54,498
JERRY:
She likes him.

921
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:55,766
I mean, she
really likes him.

922
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:57,768
How do you know?
Who wouldn't like him?

923
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:00,037
I like him,
and I'm a guy.

924
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,538
I suppose he's
an attractive man. I...

925
00:36:02,571 --> 00:36:04,106
Forget that.
He's a ballplayer.

926
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,513
MVP, 1979.

927
00:36:04,513 --> 00:36:05,774
MVP, 1979.

928
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:07,275
I'm making wisecracks
in some nightclub.

929
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:09,777
This guy was
in game six.

930
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,845
They're a perfect match.
They, like, go together.

931
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,347
They're like one of these
brother-and-sister couples

932
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,981
that look alike.

933
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:16,349
I hate those couples.

934
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,450
I could never be
one of those couples.

935
00:36:18,483 --> 00:36:21,018
There are no
bald women around,
you know.

936
00:36:23,921 --> 00:36:25,722
You know, I know
this sounds
a little arrogant,

937
00:36:25,756 --> 00:36:27,523
but I never thought
she'd find someone

938
00:36:27,557 --> 00:36:28,958
she liked better than me,

939
00:36:28,991 --> 00:36:31,126
but, you know,
I guess I had my chance,

940
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,561
and that's that.

941
00:36:32,594 --> 00:36:34,513
You know what
I'd like to do?

942
00:36:34,513 --> 00:36:34,896
You know what
I'd like to do?

943
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:38,031
I'd really like
to have sex
with a tall woman.

944
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:40,133
I mean, really tall,
like a giant...

945
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:42,001
like 6'5".

946
00:36:42,902 --> 00:36:44,470
Really?

947
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:46,305
What was the
tallest woman you
ever slept with?

948
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:48,339
I don't know, 6'3".

949
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,640
Wow!

950
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,076
God!

951
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:54,344
See, this is all
I think about--
sleeping with a giant.

952
00:36:56,212 --> 00:36:57,913
It's my life's
ambition.

953
00:36:57,946 --> 00:36:59,314
So I guess it's
fair to say

954
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:01,249
you've set different
goals for yourself

955
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:04,513
than, say, Thomas Edison,
Magellan, these types
of people.

956
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:04,986
than, say, Thomas Edison,
Magellan, these types
of people.

957
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:07,187
Magellan? You like
Magellan?

958
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,155
Oh, yeah.
My favorite explorer.

959
00:37:09,189 --> 00:37:11,190
Around the world.
Come on.

960
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:12,324
Who do you like?

961
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:13,558
I like De Soto.

962
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:16,027
De Soto? What
did he do?

963
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,361
Discovered
the Mississippi.

964
00:37:17,395 --> 00:37:19,363
Oh, yeah, like they wouldn't
have found that anyway?

965
00:37:21,932 --> 00:37:23,666
All right.

966
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,901
I got to go
down to the
unemployment office.

967
00:37:24,934 --> 00:37:26,535
You want to
take a walk?

968
00:37:26,568 --> 00:37:27,836
No, I can't.
I've got some
stuff to do,

969
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:29,504
and then I gotta meet Keith
at my apartment at 3:00,

970
00:37:29,537 --> 00:37:31,038
I'm helping him move.

971
00:37:31,071 --> 00:37:33,207
What?

972
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,513
The guy asked you
to help him move? Wow!

973
00:37:34,513 --> 00:37:36,576
The guy asked you
to help him move? Wow!

974
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,844
I know. Isn't
that something?

975
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:40,012
He's got money.
Why doesn't he just
pay a mover?

976
00:37:40,045 --> 00:37:41,914
I don't know.
He's got some
valuable antiques.

977
00:37:41,947 --> 00:37:43,381
He's worried
they'll break something.

978
00:37:44,649 --> 00:37:45,850
The next thing you know,

979
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:46,951
he's gonna have
you driving him
to the airport.

980
00:37:46,984 --> 00:37:48,719
I'm not driving him
to the airport!

981
00:37:53,956 --> 00:37:55,290
I gave.

982
00:37:55,324 --> 00:37:56,758
I gave everything
I could, Mrs. Sokol,

983
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,259
and nothing
was good enough
for her.

984
00:37:58,292 --> 00:37:59,727
Sign here, please.

985
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,529
I don't know
who she's looking for.

986
00:38:01,562 --> 00:38:03,596
I don't know. I'll tell
you something.

987
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,513
She's very particular,
your daughter.

988
00:38:04,513 --> 00:38:06,365
She's very particular,
your daughter.

989
00:38:06,398 --> 00:38:08,234
What, is she looking
for some big
hotshot businessman?

990
00:38:08,267 --> 00:38:11,369
Well, I've got
my pride too.
I'm not gonna beg her.

991
00:38:11,402 --> 00:38:13,471
All right. Just sign it.
People are waiting.

992
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:23,946
You, uh, like baseball?

993
00:38:23,979 --> 00:38:25,880
That was autographed
by the '86 Mets.

994
00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:29,283
I saw every
inning that year.

995
00:38:29,316 --> 00:38:32,218
It's funny because
I happen to be
very good friends

996
00:38:32,252 --> 00:38:34,513
with, uh, Keith Hernandez.

997
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:35,220
with, uh, Keith Hernandez.

998
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:38,590
You know Keith Hernandez?

999
00:38:38,623 --> 00:38:40,791
Know him?
(Chuckles, Snorts)

1000
00:38:40,824 --> 00:38:43,326
Would you, uh,
like to meet him?

1001
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,062
Oh, come on. Come on.

1002
00:38:46,095 --> 00:38:51,299
I can produce Keith
Hernandez right here
within the hour.

1003
00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:55,102
All right... You got
one hour.

1004
00:38:56,536 --> 00:38:58,272
All right, Mrs. S.

1005
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:02,007
I and my good pal...

1006
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,076
Keith Hernandez...

1007
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:04,513
will be right back.

1008
00:39:04,513 --> 00:39:05,943
will be right back.

1009
00:39:19,788 --> 00:39:21,789
129 West 81st Street,
and hurry.

1010
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:26,559
Or not.

1011
00:39:32,731 --> 00:39:33,764
KEITH: Better bring
your gloves.

1012
00:39:33,798 --> 00:39:34,513
It's freezing
out there.

1013
00:39:34,513 --> 00:39:35,433
It's freezing
out there.

1014
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:36,634
It shouldn't take
too long.

1015
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:39,002
I'd say maybe,
oh, four hours.

1016
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,138
Really, though, Jerry,

1017
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,306
there's not that much.

1018
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,607
First, we got the bedroom.

1019
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,941
We got two dressers
and the bed.

1020
00:39:46,974 --> 00:39:49,210
Is there a...
box spring?

1021
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:50,311
What's that?

1022
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:51,845
Is there a box spring?

1023
00:39:51,878 --> 00:39:53,046
Yeah, there's
a box spring,

1024
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:54,314
but it's attached
to the headboard,

1025
00:39:54,347 --> 00:39:56,349
and we'll have to
take that apart.

1026
00:39:56,382 --> 00:39:58,050
Then we got the couch.

1027
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:01,119
Is that a sectional?
Yeah, 12 pieces.

1028
00:40:01,152 --> 00:40:02,853
A marble coffee table.

1029
00:40:02,887 --> 00:40:04,513
Is that a thick marble?

1030
00:40:04,513 --> 00:40:04,822
Is that a thick marble?

1031
00:40:05,923 --> 00:40:07,290
Three inches thick.

1032
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:09,826
Got it in Italy.
But the big problem

1033
00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:12,060
is gonna be
the convertible sofa.

1034
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:14,295
You see,
when you move it,
it tends to open up,

1035
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,363
so it's gonna be
real difficult

1036
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:16,764
getting it
down the stairs.

1037
00:40:17,364 --> 00:40:18,565
Stairs?

1038
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:20,834
There's no elevator?

1039
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:22,736
No, it's a brownstone.
Three floors.

1040
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,642
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.
What?

1041
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:32,309
I can't do it! I can't.

1042
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:34,410
It's too soon.
I don't know you.

1043
00:40:35,946 --> 00:40:37,880
I can't help you move.

1044
00:40:37,913 --> 00:40:39,915
I'm sorry. I can't.
I just can't.

1045
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:50,857
Hello.

1046
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,058
Hello.

1047
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:55,526
Oh. You don't
remember me?

1048
00:40:57,395 --> 00:40:59,596
No. Should I?
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, you should,

1049
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,431
because I certainly
remember you.

1050
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,513
Let me refresh
your memory.

1051
00:41:04,513 --> 00:41:05,068
Let me refresh
your memory.

1052
00:41:05,101 --> 00:41:06,435
June 14th!

1053
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:08,570
1987.

1054
00:41:09,304 --> 00:41:10,438
Mets-Phillies.

1055
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:12,706
You made a big error.
Cost the Mets the game.

1056
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:14,341
Then you're coming up
the parking-lot ramp.

1057
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:17,610
You said,
"Nice game, pretty boy."

1058
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:19,278
Ah! You remember.

1059
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:22,013
Then you spit on us.

1060
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,214
Hey, I didn't spit at you.

1061
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:25,249
Oh, yeah, right.
No, no, no.
Then who was it?

1062
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:27,017
The way I
remember it...

1063
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,852
<i>I was walking</i>
<i>up the ramp.</i>

1064
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,253
<i>I was upset</i>
<i>about the game.</i>

1065
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,754
<i>That's when you called me</i>
<i>"Pretty boy."</i>

1066
00:41:32,388 --> 00:41:33,689
<i>That ticked me off,</i>

1067
00:41:33,722 --> 00:41:34,513
<i>and I turned</i>
<i>to say something,</i>

1068
00:41:34,513 --> 00:41:35,691
<i>and I turned</i>
<i>to say something,</i>

1069
00:41:35,724 --> 00:41:37,692
<i>and as I turned around,</i>

1070
00:41:37,725 --> 00:41:39,193
<i>I saw Roger McDowell</i>

1071
00:41:39,227 --> 00:41:40,861
<i>behind the bushes</i>

1072
00:41:40,895 --> 00:41:42,562
over by that
gravelly road.

1073
00:41:47,433 --> 00:41:48,701
<i>Anyway, he was talking</i>
<i>to someone,</i>

1074
00:41:48,734 --> 00:41:51,035
<i>and they were pointing at you.</i>

1075
00:41:51,068 --> 00:41:52,537
<i>I tried to scream out,</i>

1076
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,305
<i>but it was too late--</i>
<i>it was already on its way.</i>

1077
00:41:54,338 --> 00:41:55,806
I told you.

1078
00:41:57,673 --> 00:42:00,142
Wow. It was McDowell.

1079
00:42:00,175 --> 00:42:01,376
JERRY: <i>But why?</i>

1080
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,844
<i>Why McDowell?</i>

1081
00:42:04,245 --> 00:42:04,513
Well, maybe because
we were sitting

1082
00:42:04,513 --> 00:42:05,647
Well, maybe because
we were sitting

1083
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,948
in the right-field stands

1084
00:42:06,981 --> 00:42:08,916
cursing at him
in the bullpen
all game.

1085
00:42:09,683 --> 00:42:10,717
He must have

1086
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,784
caught a glimpse of us

1087
00:42:11,818 --> 00:42:13,019
when I poured that beer
on his head.

1088
00:42:14,853 --> 00:42:16,388
NEWMAN: <i>It was McDowell.</i>

1089
00:42:16,422 --> 00:42:18,156
Oh, boy.

1090
00:42:18,189 --> 00:42:20,558
Uh, look, uh, Keith,
we're sorry.

1091
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:22,292
Yeah, I couldn't
be sorrier. I, uh...

1092
00:42:22,326 --> 00:42:24,594
Oh, look, guys,
don't worry about it.

1093
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:26,329
Well, I guess
I'd better get going.

1094
00:42:26,362 --> 00:42:27,830
Now, what are
you doing?

1095
00:42:27,863 --> 00:42:29,498
Well, I gotta move.

1096
00:42:29,532 --> 00:42:31,233
You want any help?

1097
00:42:31,266 --> 00:42:32,300
I'd love some. You sure?

1098
00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:33,401
I'd love
to help you move!

1099
00:42:33,435 --> 00:42:34,513
Yeah. Me too!

1100
00:42:34,513 --> 00:42:35,069
Yeah. Me too!

1101
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:37,070
Okay, guys. We've
got to be careful
of one thing.

1102
00:42:37,103 --> 00:42:39,005
Some of the stuff
is very fragile.

1103
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:40,740
We're gonna have to
handle it like a baby.

1104
00:42:40,773 --> 00:42:42,341
Hey, no sweat.

1105
00:42:52,715 --> 00:42:54,350
(Telephone Rings)

1106
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:56,485
Hello.

1107
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:57,586
Oh, hi, Elaine.

1108
00:42:57,619 --> 00:42:59,354
What's going on?

1109
00:42:59,387 --> 00:43:01,189
No, he just left.

1110
00:43:01,222 --> 00:43:02,923
You broke up with him?

1111
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:04,158
Me too!

1112
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,626
What happened?

1113
00:43:08,327 --> 00:43:10,162
Oh, smoking.

1114
00:43:10,195 --> 00:43:11,964
You know, you're
like going out
with C. Everett Koop.

1115
00:43:13,298 --> 00:43:15,767
Me? No, I couldn't
go through with it.

1116
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,335
I just didn't feel ready.

1117
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:20,703
So what are you doing now?

1118
00:43:20,736 --> 00:43:22,104
Oh, great idea.

1119
00:43:22,137 --> 00:43:24,273
Okay, I'll meet you there
in, like, 30 minutes.

1120
00:43:24,306 --> 00:43:25,640
Okay, bye.

1121
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:28,777
Keith! Keith!

1122
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,444
What happened?
What happened?
Where's Keith?

1123
00:43:30,478 --> 00:43:32,212
You just missed him.
He just left.

1124
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,513
What do you
need him for?

1125
00:43:34,513 --> 00:43:34,981
What do you
need him for?

1126
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:38,550
Keith! Keith!

1127
00:43:38,584 --> 00:43:41,352
Up here! Could you
do me a favor?

1128
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:42,453
I need you to go

1129
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:44,454
to the unemployment
office with me!

1130
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,956
I'm--
I'm Jerry's friend--

1131
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,357
the guy from
the locker room!

1132
00:43:48,157 --> 00:43:49,959
I'm the chucker!

1133
00:43:49,993 --> 00:43:52,160
It'll take
five minutes!

1134
00:43:52,194 --> 00:43:53,228
Wait!

1135
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:54,596
(Pleading)
Wait!

1136
00:44:03,603 --> 00:44:04,513
(Sighing)

1137
00:44:04,513 --> 00:44:04,870
(Sighing)

1138
00:44:08,507 --> 00:44:10,108
Well, Biff...

1139
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:13,510
What's next?

1140
00:44:15,345 --> 00:44:16,846
I don't know.

1141
00:44:18,547 --> 00:44:20,482
Excuse me.

1142
00:44:20,516 --> 00:44:21,516
I was walking
behind you,

1143
00:44:21,549 --> 00:44:23,618
and you dropped
your wallet.

1144
00:44:28,355 --> 00:44:31,390
When you're moving, your
whole world becomes boxes.

1145
00:44:31,424 --> 00:44:33,659
That's all you think
about is boxes.

1146
00:44:33,692 --> 00:44:34,513
Where are there boxes?

1147
00:44:34,513 --> 00:44:35,227
Where are there boxes?

1148
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,695
You just wander
down the street, going
in and out of stores.

1149
00:44:37,729 --> 00:44:41,264
"Are there boxes here?
Have you seen any boxes?"

1150
00:44:41,297 --> 00:44:42,733
I mean, it's all
you think about.

1151
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:44,934
You can't even talk to people
because you can't concentrate.

1152
00:44:44,967 --> 00:44:46,802
"Shut up. I'm looking
for boxes."

1153
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,038
It's just-- after a while,

1154
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:51,239
you become, like,
really into it.

1155
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,340
You can smell them.

1156
00:44:52,373 --> 00:44:56,009
You walk in the store--
"There's boxes here.

1157
00:44:56,043 --> 00:44:57,544
"Don't tell me
you don't have boxes,
damn it!

1158
00:44:57,577 --> 00:44:59,245
"I can smell them!"

1159
00:45:01,547 --> 00:45:02,781
You become, like, obsessed.

1160
00:45:02,814 --> 00:45:04,513
"I love the smell
of cardboard in the morning."

1161
00:45:04,513 --> 00:45:05,516
"I love the smell
of cardboard in the morning."

1162
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:06,751
You could be at a funeral.

1163
00:45:06,784 --> 00:45:08,085
Everyone's mourning,
crying around you.

1164
00:45:08,118 --> 00:45:09,253
You're looking at the casket--

1165
00:45:09,286 --> 00:45:11,720
"That's a nice box.

1166
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:14,957
"Does anybody know
where that guy got that box?

1167
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:17,525
"When he's done with it,
you think I could get that?

1168
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:19,727
"It's got
some nice handles on it."

1169
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:21,628
That's what death is, really.

1170
00:45:21,662 --> 00:45:24,364
It's the last big move
of your life.

1171
00:45:24,397 --> 00:45:25,898
The hearse is like the van.

1172
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,733
The pallbearers
are your close friends,

1173
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,101
the only ones
you could really ask

1174
00:45:29,134 --> 00:45:31,369
to help you
with a big move like that,

1175
00:45:31,402 --> 00:45:33,437
and the casket
is that great, perfect box

1176
00:45:33,471 --> 00:45:34,513
you've been looking for
your whole life.

1177
00:45:34,513 --> 00:45:34,938
you've been looking for
your whole life.

1178
00:45:34,972 --> 00:45:36,106
The only problem

1179
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:38,299
is once you find it,
you're in it.

1180
00:45:39,132 --> 00:45:40,266
(♪)

1181
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:49,766
(♪)
