358
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:28,565
I saw DiMaggio
in the doughnut shop again.

359
00:13:32,865 --> 00:13:34,765
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

360
00:13:34,798 --> 00:13:36,198
Joe DiMaggio?
Joe DiMaggio.

361
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,032
You know this time I went in
and I sat down across from him

362
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:40,398
and I really watched him.

363
00:13:40,432 --> 00:13:42,865
I studied his every move.

364
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:44,398
For example...

365
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:46,232
he dunks.

366
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:49,198
Joe DiMaggio dunks
his doughnuts?

367
00:13:49,232 --> 00:13:49,299
That's right.
See, now I know it's not him.

368
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:51,498
That's right.
See, now I know it's not him.

369
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:53,432
Joe DiMaggio could not be
a dunker.

370
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,065
Oh, he's a dunker.

371
00:13:56,398 --> 00:13:57,598
Why couldn't he be
a dunker?

372
00:13:57,632 --> 00:13:59,365
And nothing diverts
his attention.

373
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:00,765
Like, I'm, you know--

374
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,598
Like, I'm sitting
in there, you know

375
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:06,232
and I start banging
on the table, you know, to--

376
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:07,398
So that he'll look up.

377
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:09,198
You know, like,
I'm sitting there, and I:

378

You know.

379
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:13,832
He wouldn't move.

380
00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:16,832

these yelping noises like,

is so focused, you see.

how he played baseball.

00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:38,698
Well, then the waitress,
she comes up and she tells me

or they're gonna throw me out.

Let me just talk to you
for a second.

510
00:18:46,716 --> 00:18:47,683
inadvertently sent in
an insurance--

511
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:49,150
I treated you,

512
00:18:49,183 --> 00:18:50,983
so please just get out
of the office.

But can't you just listen to me?
Run, Billy!

514
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,483
Run to the office
and close the door!

515

Call the police.

And a guy will appear
from out of nowhere.

You don't belong here."

They talk back.
