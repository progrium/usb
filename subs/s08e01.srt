Well, I'll see ya.

534
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:31,196
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

535
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:34,763
Man. I gotta go lay down.

536
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:36,629
Are you and George
going out a little later?

537
00:20:36,663 --> 00:20:38,463
No, he's still stuck
at the foundation.

538
00:20:38,496 --> 00:20:38,538
You know, you oughta go
down there and help him out.

539
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,629
You know, you oughta go
down there and help him out.

540
00:20:40,663 --> 00:20:41,796
He's a widower.

541
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:45,496
Widower? Wait a second.

542
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:46,696

543
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:50,463
Okay, let's see.
The beach house, 48 acres--

544
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:51,663
Ooh, Southampton.

545
00:20:51,696 --> 00:20:53,496
That should fetch
a fair price.

546
00:20:53,529 --> 00:20:55,829
Would I have had access
to that?

547
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,296
Course.
Would have been yours.

548
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:58,963
And now?

549
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:00,163
Not.

550
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:01,263
[PHONE RINGS]

551
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:02,363
Got it.

552
00:21:06,663 --> 00:21:07,629
Hello.

553
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:08,538
JERRY:
<i>Hey, Georgie.</i>

554
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:08,963
JERRY:
<i>Hey, Georgie.</i>

555
00:21:08,996 --> 00:21:10,996
I'm doing some research
down at the coffee shop.

556
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:12,596
Your story's the one.

557
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:14,796
My story?
Yeah, your widower story's

558
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:16,129
tested through the roof.

559
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:19,863
When are you getting
out of there?

560
00:21:19,896 --> 00:21:23,963
Um. Excuse me, Wyck,
are we, uh, almost done here?

561
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:26,529
[CHUCKLING]
No, no, not even close.

562
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:33,496
I can't go.

563
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:35,329
What do you mean,
you can't go?

564
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:37,663
There's two really cute girls
sitting at the counter,

565
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:38,538
eating grilled cheese.

566
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:38,963
eating grilled cheese.

567
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:40,029
Cheese, George.

568
00:21:40,063 --> 00:21:42,596
<i>Cheese.</i>

569
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:45,996
Okay, next item,
Susan's doll collection.

570
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:49,696
Estimated value: 2.6 million.

571
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:52,996
What do you say we go
through this doll by doll.

573
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:11,096
It was nothing unusual.

574
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,463
Every afternoon
for the last 24 years,

575
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:16,429
I'd shut the door to my office
and sneak a little shuteye.

576
00:22:16,463 --> 00:22:18,096
No one was the wiser.

577
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:22,596
But then my wife gets me
this urban sombrero.

578
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:25,763
The next thing I know,
my ass is out on the street.

579
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:27,696
I tried one too.

580
00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:30,963
I woke up and found my walking
papers tacked to the brim.

581
00:22:30,996 --> 00:22:33,163
Stupid J. Pendleton.

582
00:22:33,863 --> 00:22:36,296
It's "Peterman."

583
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:36,784
It's J. Peterman.

584
00:22:36,784 --> 00:22:39,429
It's J. Peterman.

585
00:22:39,463 --> 00:22:42,529
I never thought
a hat would destroy my life.
