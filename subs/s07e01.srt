Nothing.

You're under arrest.
Arrest?

555
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:02,966
I have a receipt
for a rental car

including a report of
some damage to the rear seat.

It seems as if the springs
were so compressed

559
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:12,333
that they completely collapsed
the right side.

What do you think
they'll do to us?

Ah, don't worry about a thing.

In 20 minutes,

565
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:33,833
that place will
be swarming with mailmen.

We'll be back on the street
by lunch.
