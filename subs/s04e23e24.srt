1
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:04,170
To me, the whole concept
of fear of success

2
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:06,207
is proof that
we are definitely

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,875
scraping the bottom
of the fear barrel.

4
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:10,912
Are we going to have
to have AA-type meetings

5
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,146
for these people?

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,480
Going, "Hi. My name is Bill.

7
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,149
"And the one thing
I'm worried about

8
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,719
is having a stereo
and a cream-colored couch."

9
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:20,722
According to most studies,

10
00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:23,925
people's number one fear
is public speaking.

11
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:27,329
Number two is death.

12
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:30,000
Death is number two.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,299
Death is number two.

14
00:00:32,434 --> 00:00:35,237
Now, this means,
to the average person,

15
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,739
if you have to
go to a funeral,

16
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:39,742
you're better
off in the casket than doing the eulogy.

17
00:00:45,114 --> 00:00:46,583
Why? Why can't I
play Kramer?

18
00:00:46,616 --> 00:00:48,084
Look, we've been
through this already.

19
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:49,218
You're not an actor.

20
00:00:49,252 --> 00:00:50,720
Neither are you.
I know.

21
00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:53,122
Why do we need two people
in the show that can't act?

22
00:00:53,156 --> 00:00:55,092
Oh, come on, Jerry.
How hard is it to act?

23
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,893
You say something,
I'll pretend it's funny.

24
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:58,562
Come on.

25
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:00,064
My grandmother's
in the hospital.

[LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY]

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,635
Your grandmother's
in the hospital!

28
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:08,239
Oh, this is real believable.

29
00:01:08,273 --> 00:01:09,607
What? You didn't think
I was really laughing?

30
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,941
It stinks.

31
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:10,999
All right,
let's see you do it.

32
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:12,443
All right,
let's see you do it.

33
00:01:12,477 --> 00:01:13,544
Say something funny.

34
00:01:13,578 --> 00:01:14,779
All right.

35
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:16,381
I've never been to Mars,

36
00:01:16,414 --> 00:01:18,950
but I imagine
it's quite lovely.

37
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:23,021
Mine was better than that!
Come on, look.

38
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:31,263
Why are you two
pretending to be laughing?

39
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:32,498
We're acting.

40
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:35,635
Oh. Yeah, real good.

41
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:36,669
Any word from NBC?

42
00:01:36,703 --> 00:01:38,771
No.
I don't understand.

43
00:01:38,805 --> 00:01:40,473
They're supposed to be
casting this week.

44
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:40,999
Something's wrong.
Maybe they're not doing it.

45
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:42,142
Something's wrong.
Maybe they're not doing it.

46
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:43,843
Well, at least
let me audition.

47
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:45,478
He wants to play Kramer
in the pilot.

48
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:46,579
Out of the question.
Yeah!

49
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:47,815
Oh!

50
00:01:47,848 --> 00:01:49,316
How could we
not hear anything?

51
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:50,951
What's with this Russell?
What's he doing?

52
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,156
ELAINE:
Hi, Russell.

53
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,992
Sit. Sit down.
It's okay.

54
00:01:59,026 --> 00:02:00,428
I really appreciate
you coming.

55
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:04,032
Oh, that's okay. I don't
have much time, though, so...

56
00:02:04,065 --> 00:02:06,267
All right, well,
first of all...

57
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,537
I want to apologize
for all the phone calls.

58
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,872
It's just-- It's just--

59
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:16,111
I don't understand. I mean,
we went out, once, and--

60
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:17,679
Yeah, that was
two months ago.

61
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:18,881
Yes, I know.

62
00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:22,451
And I-- I just-- I can't
get you out of my mind.

63
00:02:22,484 --> 00:02:27,222
Ever since that... That day
in that restaurant when we met.

64
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:29,659
Do you, uh...have
a ketchup secret?

65
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,061
No, I...

66
00:02:31,094 --> 00:02:36,700
Russell, you are
the president of NBC.

67
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:39,402
Okay? You can have
any woman you want.

68
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:40,999
But I want you.

69
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:42,339
But I want you.

70
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:44,207
God, I hate
these mixtures.

71
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:45,742
I don't know why--

72
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:47,544
Why don't they just put
pretzels out on the table?

73
00:02:47,578 --> 00:02:49,046
Or even peanuts
would be good.

74
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,483
But I don't know who
eats these cheesy things.

75
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:54,852
Is it something I said?

76
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:56,153
Or did?

77
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:59,524
Um... Look, Russell.

78
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:02,327
You're a very sweet guy.

79
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,932
But, um...I gotta
be honest with you.

80
00:03:06,965 --> 00:03:08,701
I don't like television.

81
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:10,999
And that's your world.
That's your life.

82
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:12,838
And that's your world.
That's your life.

83
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:14,573
I mean, maybe
if you were in, um,

84
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:16,074
I don't know,
Greenpeace or something,

85
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:17,443
that would be different,

86
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:19,011
but network television!

87
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:23,049

You're part of the problem.

89
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:25,919
some really very, very
interesting things right now.

90
00:03:25,952 --> 00:03:28,287
We've got some very exciting
pilots for next season.

91
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:30,256

a bright young comedian,

92
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:31,591
Jerry Seinfeld.

93
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,893
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah,
I've heard of him.

94
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:35,795
He's that, um,

95
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:38,698
"Did you ever notice this?
Did you ever notice that?" guy.

96
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,768
He was in the restaurant
the day that we met.

97
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:40,999
Uh-huh.

98
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:42,102
Uh-huh.

99
00:03:42,136 --> 00:03:45,072
Um...well, anyway,
it's a groundbreaking show.

100
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:46,541
Really?
What is it about?

101
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:49,877
Well, it's-- It's really--
It's very unusual.

102
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,646
It's about nothing.

103
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:54,415
What do you mean
it's about nothing?

104
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:57,719
Mmm. For example,
what did you do today?

105
00:03:57,753 --> 00:04:02,558
Um...I got up,
um, I went to work,

106
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:04,059
then I came here.

107
00:04:04,092 --> 00:04:06,295
There's a show.
That's a show.

108
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:08,897
Russell, see, I'm really
not interested in this stuff.

109
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:10,999
And I do have to
go to work, so...

110
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:12,434
And I do have to
go to work, so...

111
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:14,236
Elaine, uh...
When-- When are we--

112
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,072
When are we going
to see each other again?

113
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:17,139
I'm sorry,

114
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,741
I'm sorry, okay?

115
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:20,677

with these sweatpants?

129
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,701
You're telling the world,
"I give up!"

in normal society.

Hold on a second.

00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:22,208
Okay, great.

154
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:23,410
Thanks a lot.

155
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:26,347
Casting tomorrow at NBC, 4:00!

We're in business, baby!
The pilot's on!

You're gonna be successful!

158
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,557
What if the pilot
gets picked up

159
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,859
and it becomes a series?

160
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:40,728
That would be wonderful,
George. You'll be rich and successful.

161
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:40,999
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm worried about.

162
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:42,230
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm worried about.

163
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:43,665
God would never let me
be successful.

164
00:05:43,698 --> 00:05:45,700
He'd kill me first.
He'll never let me be happy.

165
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,569
I thought you didn't
believe in God.

166
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:49,037
I do for the bad things.

167
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:51,940
Do you hear
what you're saying?

168
00:05:51,974 --> 00:05:55,611
God isn't out
to get you, George.

169
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:58,114
What--

170
00:05:58,147 --> 00:06:00,416
What is that on your lip?

171
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,585
What?

172
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:05,554
It's like a discoloration.
It's white.

173
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,294
Yes.

174
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:10,999
Yes, it's white.

175
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,529
Yes, it's white.

176
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:13,797
Why is that white?

177

his future, wouldn't you say?

the high heels,
the pantyhose, the makeup.

1184
00:44:49,058 --> 00:44:51,393
But let me tell you,
it's even worse if you're a man.

1185
00:44:51,426 --> 00:44:54,029
Because if you're a man,
you don't know what to do.

1186
00:44:54,063 --> 00:44:56,666
That's why we're building
bridges, climbing mountains,

uncharted territories.

00:44:58,868 --> 00:45:01,571
You think we want
to do these things?

1189
00:45:01,604 --> 00:45:03,906

build a bridge.

1193
00:45:11,081 --> 00:45:12,301
I guarantee you,

1194
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,635
every astronaut,
when he comes back from space,

1195
00:45:14,668 --> 00:45:16,301

"So did you see me up there?"
