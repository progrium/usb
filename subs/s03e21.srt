1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,333
Do you think

2
00:00:02,366 --> 00:00:05,566
that the security guards
in the art museums

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,500
really ever stop anybody
from taking the paintings?

4
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:11,500
I mean, are they going up to...
"Hey, hey, hey,

5
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,066
"where do you think
you're going with that?

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,500
"Hey, come over here.
Come over here.

7
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:15,500
Give me that CÃ©zanne."

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,966
I mean, look at the job
that this man is hired to do.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,666
He's getting $5.00 an hour

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,500
to protect millions of dollars
of priceless art,

11
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:26,500
with what?

12
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,466
He's got
a light mocha brown uniform

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,000
and a <i>USA Today.</i>

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,500
and a <i>USA Today.</i>

15
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:31,633
This is what he's got.

16
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,633
I mean, crooks must
look at this guy and go,

17
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,200
"All right, all we've got to do

18
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:37,400
"is get past the folding chair
and the thermos of coffee,

19
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:38,700
we can get a Rembrandt."

20
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,566
Kramer,
would you hold still?

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,666
I can't do this
if you keep moving.

22
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,033
You're sure you don't want me
to take my clothes off?

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,900
Because I'll do it.

24
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,533
No, that's the last thing
in the world

25
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:01,966
I want you to do.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,966
Well, why don't you
take your clothes off.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,400
I don't know.

28
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,633
I don't think
Jerry would like that.

29
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,165
Well, it'll be
our little secret.

30
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:11,400
Well, it'll be
our little secret.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,966
GEORGE: God!

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,966
[BANGING]

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,900
Aah!

34
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:20,800
Button fly!

35
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,633
Why do they put buttons
on a fly?

36
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,400
It takes 10 minutes
to get these things open!

37
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:28,833
I like the button fly.

38
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:30,066
What?

39
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,566
That is one place
on my wardrobe

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,800
I do not need sharp,
interlocking metal teeth.

41
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:38,133
That's like a mink trap
down there.

42
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,165
I'm going to develop
kidney problems.

43
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:40,300
I'm going to develop
kidney problems.

44
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,233
What are you doing today?
Nothing.

45
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:43,733
I have to go meet Nina.

46
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:45,366
You want to come
up to her loft,

47
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,633
check out her paintings?

48
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:47,900
I don't get art.

49
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,633
There's nothing to get.

50
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,700
No, it always has to be
explained to me,

51
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:55,066
and then I have to have someone
explain the explanation.

52
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,466
She does a lot
of abstract stuff.

53
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,166
In fact, she's painting
Kramer right now.

54
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,300
What for?

55
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,366
She sees something in him.

56
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,700
Well, so do I,

57
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:06,366
but I wouldn't
hang it on a wall.

58
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,233
Are you getting
the eyes?

59
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:10,165
Because they're brown.

60
00:02:10,165 --> 00:02:10,733
Because they're brown.

61
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:12,566
Really, they're dark brown,

62
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,900
like rich Colombian coffee.

63
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:19,066
Tell me about Elaine.

64
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,533
You know, she and Jerry
were a big thing,

65
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:23,600
like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.

66
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,066
But they're still friends.

67
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,566
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They're like this.

68
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,233
Don't you think that's strange?

69
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:33,066
Why? What's the difference?

70
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,200
Well, are you still friends
with any of your ex-girlfriends?

71
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:40,033
Well, you know, I...

72
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:40,165
I have many relationships.

73
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:44,233
I have many relationships.

74
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:45,900
I'll tell you,
I'm a little nervous.

75
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,200
Why?

76
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,033
You know, the friend
meeting the new woman.

77
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:53,966
I feel like I'm getting
fixed up for a friendship.

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,066
I don't know how long
this is going to last.

79
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,400
Really?
Yeah.

80
00:02:57,433 --> 00:02:58,833
I thought
you liked her.

81
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:01,333
I do, but she's got, like,
a jealousy thing.

82
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:03,800
I mean, she doesn't like me
having fun with anyone but her.

83
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,433
You know, it's a miracle
you're not married.

84
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,800
Hey, I'm not obligated
to buy anything, am I?

85
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:15,833
Hi, Nina.

86
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:16,866
Hi.

87
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,233
This is my friend George.

88
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:19,466
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

89
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,033
I've heard a lot about you.

90
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,933
Hey, look at this guy!

91
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:27,166
I brought George up
to see some of your paintings.

92
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Oh. Are you
interested?

93
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:33,033
Uh...

94
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:35,066
Yeah, sure.
Sure, I'm interested.

95
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,600
George,
you going to buy a painting?

96
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:39,533
Yeah, sure.

97
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:40,165
Are you
an art lover?

98
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:41,166
Are you
an art lover?

99
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,633
I'm an art adorer.
I adore art.

100
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,233
Great. Well, uh,
take a look around.

101
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:50,233
Pick something out
you like.

102
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,033
May I?

103
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,966
[LAUGHING]
Get out of here.

104
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,233
Here. Play with this.

105
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,566
What's this?

106
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,566
My father gave me four tickets
to the Yankee game

107
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,366
for Saturday afternoon.

108
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,233
Owner's box,
first row behind the dugout.

109
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:08,166
Oh, Saturday. I'm working.
I'm going out of town.

110
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,165
Oh. Well, I'm not going
to go without you.

111
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:10,366
Oh. Well, I'm not going
to go without you.

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,533
Hey, you guys want them?

113
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:13,166
Yeah.

114
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,833
They're right behind
the dugout, George,

115
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:16,033
first row.

116
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:17,700
Right behind the dugout?
Are you kidding?

117
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,000
How did you get them?

118
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:21,033
Oh, my father's
the Yankees' accountant.

119
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:22,633
It's the owner's box.

120
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,800
All my life,

121
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,400
I've dreamed
of sitting front row,

122
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,833
behind the dugout.

123
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:29,600
You like that one?

124
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,900
GEORGE:
Look at where we are!

125
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:36,033
He's not stopping.

126
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:38,666
He just keeps going
and going and going.

127
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,165
GEORGE: We're not
in the first row?

128
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:40,800
GEORGE: We're not
in the first row?

129
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,200
USHER: No, no.
These are your seats.

130
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:45,033
She said first row,
right behind the dugout.

131
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:47,033
Well, it's the second row.
It's just as good.

132
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:48,633
I was all primed
for the first row.

133
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,633
I was going to put
my feet on the dugout.

134
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,633
Will you shut up?

135
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,900
These are...
These are great.

136
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:54,566
You can't get
any better than this.

137
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,700
Oh, there's better.

138
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:56,966
Right there.
That's better.

139
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,400
All right.
Oh, boy.

140
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,966
All right,
who wants a dog?

141
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,700
Yeah. Here you go.

142
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,033
What a great day.

143
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:05,333
I could have been

144
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:07,000
at my boss' son's <i>bris</i>
right now.

145
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:08,566
That's what you were
supposed to do today?

146
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah.
Huh.

147
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:10,165
What makes him think

148
00:05:10,165 --> 00:05:11,166
What makes him think

149
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,700
anyone wants to witness
a circumcision?

150
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:15,866
I'd rather go
to a hanging.

151
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,033
Is it that unattractive
to have to take it off?

152
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:21,033
Have you ever seen one
with it?

153
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:22,533
No.

154
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:24,933
You wouldn't even know
what it was.

155
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:29,033
Anyway, I called him back.

156
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:30,500
I told him

157
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:34,033
I had to go visit my father
in the hospital in Maryland.

158
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:36,033
You better catch it
here, Charlie,

159
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:38,500
because this ain't
Philadelphia!

160
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:40,165
George?
Yeah?

161
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:40,666
George?
Yeah?

162
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,966
Hi. I'm Leonard West.

163
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,200
Nina's father.

164
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:45,633
Oh, hi, hi, Mr. West.

165
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,300
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is my friend Elaine.

166
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,800
Hi.

167
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,366
Hey, .230 ain't going to
cut it in this town, babe!

168
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,700
Hee hee! Ha ha!

169
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:54,300
And this is Kramer.

170
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh, hey,
how you doing?

171
00:05:57,766 --> 00:05:58,733
[APPLAUSE]

172
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:01,400
Yes! Yes!

173
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,366
How are the seats, huh?

174
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,366
Uh, okay.

175
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,700
Great. They're great.

176
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,300
I hear you bought
one of Nina's paintings.

177
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,300
Yeah, it's, uh...

178
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,300

Oh, that's unbelievable.

Oh, that's unbelievable.

All right, Lenny.

And he handles
the Yankees too.

00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:29,775
It's his biggest account.

Anyway, she refused
to take the cap off.
