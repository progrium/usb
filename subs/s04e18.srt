1
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:03,533
The life expectancy now
is, uh,

2
00:00:03,566 --> 00:00:05,133
72, I think, for men.

3
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:07,233
Seventy-five or six
or something for women.

4
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:09,900
It's amazing to think that just
a couple thousand years ago,

5
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:11,900
life expectancy was 30.

6
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:13,566
Which, in our terms, would mean

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,400
that you'd get
your driver's license around 5,

8
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,333
you'd marry at 9,
divorced at 15.

9
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:22,466
In your late teens,
you move down to Florida.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,800
I guess that's how spring break
got started, I don't know.

11
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,400
Then, eventually, people
are saying things about you

12
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:28,900
like, "Well, it's amazing.

13
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:30,000
"He's 28,
but he's still very alert.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,733
"He's 28,
but he's still very alert.

15
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:32,466
"His mind is so sharp,

16
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,433
you would think you're talking
to a 2-year-old."

17
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,466
Aw, what's the point?

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,833
[SIGHS]

19
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:45,300
When I like them,
they don't like me.

20
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,700
When they like me,
I don't like them.

21
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,700
Why can't I act
with the ones I like

22
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:52,733
the way I do
with the ones I don't like?

23
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:55,500
Well, you've only got
another 50 years or so to go,

24
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:57,366
and it'll all be over.

25
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,400
Maybe I need someone
who doesn't speak English.

26
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:05,833
Yeah. How about a mute?

27
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:05,911
A mute would be good.

28
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:08,833
A mute would be good.

29
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:11,500
Ah, where are you
gonna meet a mute?

30
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:13,333
This is what my life
has come to,

31
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:15,733
trying to meet a mute.

32
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:18,733
I don't know, Jerry.
Something's missing.

33
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:22,466
There's a void, Jerry.
There's a void.

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
A deep, yawning chasm.

35
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:28,000
There's got to be more to life
than this.

36
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:30,100
What gives you pleasure?

37
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:33,233
Listening to you.

38
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:35,911
I listen to this for 15 minutes,
I'm on top of the world.

39
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:36,566
I listen to this for 15 minutes,
I'm on top of the world.

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,833
Your misery is my pleasure.

41
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:39,833
Hey, boys.

42
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,366
Hey, how you doing?

43
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Good. Okay.
Well, it's all set.

44
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:44,733
I start tomorrow.

45
00:01:44,766 --> 00:01:46,300
Start what?

46
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,900
I signed up
to do volunteer work

47
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,566
with senior citizens.

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,033
Really?
ELAINE: Yeah.

49
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:53,133
God, I can't
tell you how I feel.

50
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,300
I mean,
I feel so good!

51
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,966
I really
feel good!

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,066
The strange thing is,

53
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,966
I mean, I haven't even
met the woman yet.

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,466
Volunteer work, huh?

55
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,900
What are you gonna
do down there?

56
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:04,233
Well, they say
all it is,

57
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:05,733
is you go over
to their apartment,

58
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:05,911
and, I don't know,
you take them out for a walk,

59
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:08,033
and, I don't know,
you take them out for a walk,

60
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:09,366
you get
a cup of coffee,

61
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,133
and it's supposed to
make them feel good.

62
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,766
That's what I do
with him.

63
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,200
When did you get this idea?

64
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:19,400
Last time I had
lunch with you here.

65
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:21,666
You were going on
and on and on

66
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,066
about how you wanted
to meet somebody

67
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,433
who didn't speak English.

68
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:28,733
What, you break it in with her,
then you try it out on me?

69
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:29,733
All right.

70
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:32,300
A-a-and anybody could do this?

71
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,466
Yeah.

72
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,533
Really?

73
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:35,911
Helping people.

74
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:37,200
Helping people.

75
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:39,733
Of course.

76
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:41,233
Of course!

77
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:43,033
It makes perfect sense.

78
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:46,033
How could I not be doing this?

79
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,000
I am gonna help somebody,
damn it!

80
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:51,000
What about you?
Nah, it's not for me.

81
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:53,400
Jerry, if anybody should be
doing this, it's you.

82
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:56,400
What kind of a person are you?

83
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:58,900
I think I'm pretty much
like you...

84
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:01,433
only successful.

85
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,733
This is a wonderful thing
you're doing.

86
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:09,900
They're so grateful

87
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:11,333
just to have
someone to talk to.

88
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:13,500
And I can tell you
that everyone who participates

89
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,966
finds the experience
extremely rewarding.

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,566
Well, I feel better
already.

91
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,333
I-- I'm feeling
like a good person.

92
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,733
Good luck.

Thank you.

your guy's name again?

87 years old.

98
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,166
Wow, 87. Hmm.
Yeah.

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
How about your guy?

100
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:35,911
Uh, Ben Cantwell, 85.

101
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:36,900
Uh, Ben Cantwell, 85.

102
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,233
Hmm!
Huh?

So, what's up, diggety-dog?

107

George and I just signed up

108
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,466
with the senior citizens
volunteer agency.

109
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,633
Same thing Elaine's doing.

Oh, that's too bad.

111
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,000
Now, don't say I didn't
try to warn you.

112
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:01,133
What are you talking about?

113
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,833
Oh, Jerry,
I'm surprised at you!

114
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:05,911
What?
It's a con!

115
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:06,866
What?
It's a con!

116
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,533
These agencies
are usually a front

117
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:11,066
for some money-laundering
scheme,

118
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,566

bilking people
out of their life savings.

Oh, yeah.

Where do you get this?

122
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,233
The alternative

So did you ask him
about the records?

00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:45,066
What records?
Uh, well, uh...

138
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,733

Why is that?

Because the mail never stops.

that goiter's gonna start
talking to me.

You'd think
that they'd mention

something like that

over there.

But, no, no, I didn't get
any goiter information.

343
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:05,483
They really should
mention that

in the breakdown:
height, weight, goiter.

00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,383
we were just trying to
take him to the dentist.

533
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,483
Why were you taking him
to the dentist?

534
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:28,849
Uh, well, his false teeth
got mangled up

535
00:18:28,883 --> 00:18:30,316
in the garbage disposal.

536
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:32,816
What were his false teeth
doing in the garbage disposal?

537
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:34,049
Well, after he bit my friend--

538
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,249
Bit your friend?!

539
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,322
What the hell is going on here?

540
00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:38,349
What the hell is going on here?

541
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,749
How do you lose a human being?

542
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:41,749
Well, I-- I am sorry--

543
00:18:41,783 --> 00:18:43,149
And who were these other people?

544
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:44,983
What were they doing
in the apartment?

545
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:47,116
Well, I brought them up there
to take his records.

546
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:50,083
Take his records?

547
00:18:50,116 --> 00:18:53,316
Do you realize how valuable
that record collection is?

548
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,516
There you are.
Did you find him?

549
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:57,649
Nah. Uh, you know, we took
the old man's records

550
00:18:57,683 --> 00:18:59,549
over to Ron's,
and he tried to screw us,

551
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,916
and then we got into a fight.

552
00:19:00,949 --> 00:19:02,983
It was
a real melee.

553
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,916
Yeah, a real brouhaha.

554
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:06,816
Then all
the records broke.

555
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:07,322
The records?

556
00:19:07,322 --> 00:19:08,216
The records?

557
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:10,049
My father's records?

558
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,749
Uh--
Did anybody try and call him?

559
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,583
Yeah, I called,
but there's no answer.

560
00:19:13,616 --> 00:19:15,016
Well, the line's busy now.

561
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:18,049
The line's busy.
He must be home.

562
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:22,749
[WILD, EXOTIC MUSIC PLAYING]

563
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:39,383
W-w-we, uh...

564
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:43,016
We-- We couldn't
find him.

565
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,483
What the hell's
the point?

566
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:51,216
When you like them,
they don't like you,

567
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:53,516
and when they like you,
you don't like them.

568
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:55,816
Oh, you don't know
what you want.

569
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:57,649
You should see a psychiatrist.

570
00:19:57,683 --> 00:19:59,549
Yeah, I got fixed up last week.

571
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,549
Yeah. I never would
get "fixed up."

572
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,016
I go to pick her up,

573
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:05,649
and she opens the door,

574
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:07,322
and she's got this huge goiter

575
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:07,983
and she's got this huge goiter

576
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:10,516
growing out
of the side of her neck.

577
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:12,583
It looked like a football.

578
00:20:13,683 --> 00:20:15,349
Well, what did you do?

579
00:20:15,383 --> 00:20:17,316
Well, we get
to talking,

580
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,316
and as it turns out,

581
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:21,149
the woman knew Gandhi.

582
00:20:21,183 --> 00:20:22,249
Huh.

583
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:24,383
We talked for hours.

584
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,749
Well, uh, are you gonna
see her again?

585
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:29,216
We were getting along real good,

586
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:32,049
and then she made some tea.

587
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,416
Put some milk in it
without asking me.

588
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:36,983
Now, that's a turnoff.

589
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:37,322
Ah, you don't need that.

590
00:20:37,322 --> 00:20:38,883
Ah, you don't need that.

591
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:41,984
To me, the thing
about old people

592
00:20:42,017 --> 00:20:43,717
is that everything about them
gets smaller.

593
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,984
You know,
their bodies get smaller.

594
00:20:46,017 --> 00:20:47,617
They move into smaller places.

595
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,817
They sleep less time.

596
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,984
They eat smaller meals.

597
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:51,350
Except the car.

598
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,484
The older they get,
the bigger their car gets.

599
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:55,150
I've never understood that.

600
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:57,550
And old people have a way
of backing out of the driveway.

601
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:58,617
You know what I mean?

602
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,017
They don't turn
from side to side.

603
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,817
They just go, "I'm old.
I've been waiting a long time.

604
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,317
I'm backing it out."

605
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,984
You know? "I'm coming back.

606
00:21:06,017 --> 00:21:07,322
Watch out, buddy. I'm coming."
You know?

607
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:07,650
Watch out, buddy. I'm coming."
You know?

608
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,284
And you've got to watch out
for them.

609
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:10,817
And then,
once they get out there,

610
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,217
they drive so slowly,

611
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,017
and I would think
the less time you have in life,

612
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,484
the faster you would want to go.
You know?

613
00:21:17,517 --> 00:21:19,850
I think old people should
be allowed to drive their age.

614
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:21,950
If you're 80, do 80.

615
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:23,650
If you're 100, go 100.

616
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:25,384
They can't see
where they're going anyway.

617
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,517
Let them have
a little fun out there.
