1
00:00:00,741 --> 00:00:03,641
The whale's supposed to be
such an intelligent animal.

2
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:04,975
You know, you always hear about

3
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:07,675
how they can communicate
by song from miles away,

4
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:09,841
how extensive
their vocabulary is.

5
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,341
I would say, from the rate
we're pushing the whales

6
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,175
off the beach,
back into the ocean,

7
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,875
the words
"shore" and "close"

8
00:00:15,908 --> 00:00:19,041
do not appear to be
in their vocabulary.

9
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:21,641
I'd tell the whales,
"Concentrate less on the singing,

10
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:23,508
"a little more
on the approaching

11
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:26,541
"Cuervo Beach
volleyball tournament,

12
00:00:26,575 --> 00:00:29,575
if you wanna maintain
that brainy mammal image."

<i>Oh, I can't</i> <i>believe this.</i>

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,877
<i>What a dope!</i>

15
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,710
Excuse me.
I-I'm sorry.

16
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:45,610
This is, uh-- This is
kind of embarrassing,

17
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:48,777
but there's no toilet paper
over here.

18
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,943
Are you talking
to me?

19
00:00:50,977 --> 00:00:53,043
Yeah. I just
forgot to check,

20
00:00:53,077 --> 00:00:55,310
so if you could
spare some...

21
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:57,377
No, I'm sorry.

22
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,743
What?

23
00:00:58,777 --> 00:01:00,577
No, I'm sorry.
I can't spare it.

24
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,823
You can't
spare it?

25
00:01:01,823 --> 00:01:02,110
You can't
spare it?

26
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:03,910
No. There's not
enough to spare.

27
00:01:03,943 --> 00:01:04,943
Well, I don't
need much.

28
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:06,877
Just three squares
will do it.

29
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,877
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,110
I don't have
three squares.

31
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:10,243
Now, if you
don't mind...

32
00:01:10,277 --> 00:01:11,910
Three squares?

33
00:01:11,943 --> 00:01:13,610
You can't spare
three squares?

34
00:01:13,643 --> 00:01:15,243
No, I don't have
a square to spare.

35
00:01:15,277 --> 00:01:16,610
I can't spare
a square!

36
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,743
Well, is it
two-ply?

37
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:21,410
Because if it's two-ply,
I'll take one ply.

38
00:01:21,443 --> 00:01:23,110
One ply.

39
00:01:23,143 --> 00:01:24,277
One puny little ply.

40
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,243
I'll take one
measly ply!

41
00:01:26,277 --> 00:01:29,410
Look, I don't have a square,
and I don't have a ply!

42
00:01:29,443 --> 00:01:31,823
No, no, don't go!
I beg you!

43
00:01:31,823 --> 00:01:32,777
No, no, don't go!
I beg you!

[SIGHS]

45
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,443
Mmm. I love this
artificial flavoring.

46
00:01:38,477 --> 00:01:40,643
I like it
better than butter.

47
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:42,610
I think it's
more consistent.

48
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:44,543
You would not believe what
just happened to me

49
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:45,543
in the bathroom.
What?

50
00:01:45,577 --> 00:01:46,743
Hey.
Hey.

51
00:01:46,777 --> 00:01:49,210
Hey, where's
my popcorn, babe?

52
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,410
What?

53
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,410
My popcorn.

54
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:52,977
You were supposed
to get me popcorn.

55
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,577
What, did you forget
about me, babe?

56
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,777
You would
not believe

57
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,543
what just happened to me
in the bathroom.

58
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,043
I mean, a person needs
a certain amount

59
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:01,823
of toilet paper
to be covered.

60
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:02,377
of toilet paper
to be covered.

61
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,377
That's right.

62
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,810
I simply could not
spare it.

63
00:02:04,843 --> 00:02:06,477
This woman just
didn't get it.

64
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,877
She kept
harassing me.

65
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,877
Three squares!

66
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,443
That's all I was
asking for.

67
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:12,377
Three squares!

68
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,910
She wouldn't stop.

69
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:15,543
"Help me!
Help me!"

70
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:18,110
She was insane.

71
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:19,643
I was
begging her.

72
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:21,910
"Please,
please!"

73
00:02:21,943 --> 00:02:25,043
She was insane!

74
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:27,977
Who does she
think she is? How dare she.

75
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,410
Do you want me
to get the manager?

76
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:31,143
Too bad they don't
have those old ladies

77
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:31,823
walking around with
flashlights anymore. We'd flush her out.

78
00:02:31,823 --> 00:02:33,910
walking around with
flashlights anymore. We'd flush her out.

79
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:35,810
I don't even know
what she looks like.

80
00:02:35,843 --> 00:02:38,310
I wonder where
Elaine is sitting.

81
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:39,710
I really wanted you
to meet her.

82
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:40,943
She's supposed to
be here

83
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:42,243
with her new
boyfriend, Tony.

84
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:44,210
I wonder where
Jerry's sitting.

85
00:02:44,243 --> 00:02:45,610
He's supposed to
be here tonight

86
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:46,877
with his
new girlfriend.

87
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,743
I'm dying to see
what she looks like.

88
00:02:49,777 --> 00:02:52,043
Hey, you think if I
jumped off that balcony,

89
00:02:52,077 --> 00:02:54,010
I'd get hurt?

90
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,577
Hey.
JERRY: Hey.

91
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,243
Hey, guy.

92
00:03:01,277 --> 00:03:01,823
Can I use your phone
in your bedroom?

93
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:03,410
Can I use your phone
in your bedroom?

94
00:03:03,443 --> 00:03:04,710
What's the matter
with yours?

95
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:07,577
Uh, my batteries
are dead.

96
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,943
It's not one of those
976 calls, is it?

97
00:03:10,977 --> 00:03:12,077
Come on.
Let me use it.

98
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,643
Five minutes.
I'll pay you back, huh?

99
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:17,043
Why do you do that?

100
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:21,410
I am <i>never</i> going
to the movies again.

101
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:23,443
Hey, where were you last night?
I looked for you.

102
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:24,543
I looked for you too.

103
00:03:24,577 --> 00:03:25,943
I was all the way
over on the side.

104
00:03:25,977 --> 00:03:27,477
Oh, with, uh,
pretty boy...

105
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,110
Tony.
Ya.

106
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:30,610
Hey. Hey.
Right, okay.

107
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:31,823
Tony. Hey. Hey.

108
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:32,610
Tony. Hey. Hey.

109
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:33,777
That's nice.
Listen.

110
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,977
Listen to this.

111
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,977
I am in the bathroom

112
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,377
right before
the movie starts,

113
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,743
Uh-huh.

114
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:41,777
and I'm in the stall,
and there's no toilet paper.

115
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,977
No what?

116
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,777
Toilet paper.

117
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,277
Oh. Whoa.

118
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,077
So I ask
this woman

119
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,610
in the stall
next to me for some,

120
00:03:52,643 --> 00:03:55,110
and she refuses!

121
00:03:55,143 --> 00:03:56,243
Ha, ha!

122
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,410
Well, maybe she
couldn't spare it.

123
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:03,210
A square?

124
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,077
Well, you know, sometimes
a square is everything.

125
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,943
A ply?

126
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:09,743
Elaine, you cannot
judge a person

127
00:04:09,777 --> 00:04:11,210
in a situation
like that.

128
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:12,310
I mean,
it's like asking

129
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:13,910
for someone's canteen
in the desert!

130
00:04:13,943 --> 00:04:15,743
Yeah.
It's battle conditions.

131
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:19,777
Yeah, well, I just hope
I run into her again, okay?

132
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,810
'Cause I will never
forget that flinty voice.

133
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:24,410
It is tattooed
in my brain.

134
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:27,610
If I hear it,
watch out.

135
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,710
So, listen, what happened
with Jane last night?

136
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:30,743
Oh...

137
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:31,823
Jane, she, uh...
She, uh...

138
00:04:31,823 --> 00:04:33,410
Jane, she, uh...
She, uh...

139
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:35,777
The four of us are going out
Saturday, right?

140
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,810
That should be fun.

141
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,377
Yeah, that should be
real fun.

142
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,910
You know what?
It's getting late.

143
00:04:42,943 --> 00:04:43,943
Can I call Tony?

144
00:04:43,977 --> 00:04:45,243
Yeah.

WOMAN [SEXY VOICE]:
<i>Then we'll get a cab</i>

146
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,443

147
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:51,910
<i>How's that, Andre?</i>

148
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:53,043
Andre?
Oh.

149
00:04:53,077 --> 00:04:55,777
KRAMER:
<i>Well, what about the driver?</i>

150
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,243
<i>We might get</i>

152
00:04:59,743 --> 00:05:01,823
KRAMER:
<i>Well, that wouldn't</i> <i>be very good.</i>

153
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,810
KRAMER:
<i>Well, that wouldn't</i> <i>be very good.</i>

154
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:06,910
Hey, Andre,
get the hell off the phone!

155
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,543
Wait, what is
going on?

156
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:10,810
Who is Andre?

157
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,077
Kramer's Andre.

158
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,977
He's fooling around
with these 976 numbers.

159
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,143
Hey, I told ya,

160
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:18,210
I don't want you doing that
on my phone!

161
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:19,310
Jerry,
I'm telling you,

162
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:21,110
this phone sex thing
is hilarious!

163
00:05:21,143 --> 00:05:22,777
Like this Erica woman.
Here, look.

164
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,777
You gotta call her.

165
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,977
What a voice
she uses.

166
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,310
Hey, you know,
it's weird

167
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:28,810
because that voice sounded
a little familiar to me.

168
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:30,243
You hungry?
Wanna go to Monk's?

169
00:05:30,277 --> 00:05:31,810
No. I gotta go
downtown.

170
00:05:31,843 --> 00:05:33,977
Wait, you're giving me
a lift home, right? Yeah.

171
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,977
So listen,

172
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,110
what happened
last night with Jane?

173
00:05:37,143 --> 00:05:38,143
Oh, nothing.

174
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:40,243
She just, uh,
choked on a jujube.

175
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:41,277
Oh.

176

Step off.
Step off.

534
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:05,235
Oh!

535
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:07,868
George, wait, wait.

536
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:08,868
Yes?

537
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:11,268
Would you throw
this trash out?

538
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:17,635
Ah, oh, I been waiting
a while for this.

539
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:25,368
You know, it's a shame
Tony got all banged up,

540
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:27,435
because we can't get
together on Saturday night.

541
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:29,268
Ah, that's too bad.
What a shame.

542
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:30,720
Yeah. It is.
It's a damn shame.

543
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,768
Yeah. It is.
It's a damn shame.

544
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,235
A damn shame!

545
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:35,101
Well, maybe when
he's feeling better.

546
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:37,268
Yeah. Without a doubt.
I'm down.

547
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:38,268
Whoo!

548
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:39,635
Oh, hey.
How you doing?

549
00:17:39,668 --> 00:17:40,635
Hey, hey.

550
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:42,101
Jane, this is
my neighbor Kramer.

551
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:44,768
Oh, hey.
Hello, Kramer.

553
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:53,568
Well, hello,
Jane.

554
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:55,635
Jerry's told me
so much about you.

555
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:57,201
I feel like I know
you intimately.

556
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:58,601
Oh, I don't
think so.

557
00:17:58,635 --> 00:18:00,720
We never met. I never
talked to you on the phone.

558
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:00,935
We never met. I never
talked to you on the phone.

559
00:18:00,968 --> 00:18:02,035
See you.

560
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:03,468
Where ya
going? Uptown. To the Y.

561
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:04,568
Oh, I'm going
uptown too.

562
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:05,735
You wanna
split a cab?

563
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:08,068
What about
the driver?

564
00:18:11,835 --> 00:18:13,735
What are you
talking about?

565
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:15,101
All right,
I changed my mind.

566
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,535
I don't think
I'm gonna go now.

567
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:18,535
Oh. All right, well,
see you later.

568
00:18:18,568 --> 00:18:19,701
Nice meeting you.

569
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:21,935
See you.

571
00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:25,101
What's with you?

572
00:18:25,135 --> 00:18:26,368
That's her!
Who?

573
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:27,568
Erica!
She's Erica!

574
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:30,601
You think she's Erica,
the phone-sex woman?

575
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:30,720
Jerry, that voice

576
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,601
Jerry, that voice

577
00:18:31,635 --> 00:18:32,901
is tattooed
on my brain.

578
00:18:32,935 --> 00:18:34,068
It's her.

579
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:35,268
I'm telling you,
it's her!

580
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:36,268
You're crazy!

581
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:37,368
Am I?

582
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:43,068
Or am I so sane that
you just blew your mind?

583
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:44,301
It's impossible!

584
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:45,301
Is it?

585
00:18:45,335 --> 00:18:46,868
Or is it so possible

586
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:50,435
that your head
is spinning like a top?

587
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:51,435
It can't be!

588
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:52,701
Can't it?

589
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:53,635
Or is your entire world

590
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:55,901
just crashing down
all around you?

591
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,301
All right.
That's enough.

592
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:59,001
Yeah!

593
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:05,068
He's supposed to get
the bandages off on Sunday.

594
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,801
What if?

595
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:08,535
What?

596
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:11,435
You know...

597
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:14,135
Oh. You're afraid he might
look like Zippy the Pinhead.

598
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:16,935
Yeah, I mean,
I mean,

599
00:19:16,968 --> 00:19:18,468
what is my obligation
here?

600
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:20,135
You know,
we were just dating.

601
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:21,601
It was probably
gonna be over

602
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:23,468
in a couple of weeks
anyway.

603
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:25,935
Oh. I thought you didn't
care about his looks.

604
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:27,135
I lied.

605
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:29,135
Ah-ha.

606
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,235
Are you kidding?

607
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:30,720
He's a mimbo.
I know that.

608
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,368
He's a mimbo.
I know that.

609
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:35,368
But he's my mimbo,
you know,

610
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:37,601
and even if he is
a hideous freak,

611
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,701
maybe... Maybe I can
learn to love him,

612
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:44,601
and maybe in some
final irony,

613
00:19:44,635 --> 00:19:50,801
I'll learn what love
really is.

614
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:52,435
You know, Jerry?

615
00:19:52,468 --> 00:19:56,101
I'm sorry. I didn't get
most of that.

over there?

Hey.

meet me here.

Now we're gonna
find out the truth.

to meet you?

chemistry.

find you here.

talking about?

How could you say things
like that over the phone?

What are you talking about?

Excuse me. Do you have
a tissue?

No, I'm sorry.

00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:40,035
I can't spare it.

There's just not
enough to spare.

the ladies' room?

643

Eh.

644
00:20:48,235 --> 00:20:51,435
I have to go
to the bathroom too.

Oh, damn.

wrong?

00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,135
Yeah, there's no
toilet paper in here.

648
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:12,868
I usually check.
But would you mind?

649
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:15,201
I can't.
I don't have it.

650
00:21:15,235 --> 00:21:17,401
I don't have
a square to spare.

Now, of course, the thing
is extreme sports:

663
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:04,047
bungee jumping.

664
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,647
To me, if bungee jumping
as a sport,

665
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,380
so is being
a crash-test dummy.

666
00:22:07,414 --> 00:22:10,180
Just leaning does not
make it a sport.

667

It's like a Wile E. Coyote
idea, isn't it?

668
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,714
The thing I wonder about
in skydiving

669
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:17,347
is why do they even
bother with the helmets?

670

Can you almost make it?

671
00:22:22,147 --> 00:22:24,380
You might as well
wear a party hat.

What's the difference?

673
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:29,447
You jump out of a plane

the chute doesn't open,
I got news for you.

676
00:22:31,747 --> 00:22:34,180
The helmet is now
wearing you for protection.

677
00:22:34,214 --> 00:22:37,347
Later on, the helmet's talking
to the other helmets, going,

678
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,880
"Boy, it's a good thing
he was there,

679
00:22:38,914 --> 00:22:40,847
"or I would have hit
the ground directly."
