00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:34,996
"Hospital receives grant
to conduct DNA research.

178
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:37,329
Government funds genetic
research at area hospital."

179
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:38,562
Yeah? So?

180
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:40,162
Pig-man, baby.
Pig-man!

181
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:43,669
If I have to hear about
this pig-man one more time--

182
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,396
If I have to hear about
this pig-man one more time--

183
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:46,562
Hey, I'm telling you,

184
00:06:46,596 --> 00:06:47,962
the pig-man is alive!

185
00:06:47,996 --> 00:06:49,629
The government has been
experimenting

186
00:06:49,662 --> 00:06:51,062
with pig-men
since the fifties!

187
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:52,996
Oh, will you stop it.
Just because they're

188
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:56,496
conducting DNA research doesn't
mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!

189
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:58,296
Jerry, will you
wake up to reality?

190
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:00,662
It's a military thing!

191
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:03,662
They're probably creating
a whole army of pig warriors!

192
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:08,996
I'll tell you something.

193
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,262
I wish
there were pig-men.

194
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:13,129
You get a few of these pig-men
walking around,

195
00:07:13,162 --> 00:07:13,669
suddenly I'm looking
a lot better.

196
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:15,462
suddenly I'm looking
a lot better.

197
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:17,096
That way if someone
wanted to fix me up,

198
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:19,896
they could say,
"Hey, at least he's no pig-man!"

199
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:22,829
Believe me, there'd be plenty
of women going for these pig-men.

200
00:07:22,862 --> 00:07:24,262
Whatever their
deformity is,

201
00:07:24,296 --> 00:07:26,629
there's always some group
of perverts attracted to it.

202
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:28,629
"Ooh, that little tail
really turns me on!"

203
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:31,629
That's just about
enough.

204
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:33,096
This doesn't
interest you?

205
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:36,096
Oh, no, it's fascinating,
but could you do me a favor?

206
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:38,262
Could you tape the rest of

207
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:40,962
"The Pig-men and the Women
Who Love Them" discussion,

208
00:07:40,996 --> 00:07:43,669
and I'll listen to it
the next time I'm here.

209
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:44,262
and I'll listen to it
the next time I'm here.

210
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,996
I got to go find
a <i>mohel.</i>

211
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:47,896
You know, you should
call that off, Elaine.

212
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:49,496
It's a barbaric ritual!

213
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:53,829
Well, perhaps one day
when the pig-men roam free,

214
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:55,962
it will be stopped,
Kramer.

215
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:58,596
Until then,
off with their heads!

216
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:03,396
Kramer, isn't it
a question of hygiene?

217
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:05,496
It's a myth.

218
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:07,562
Besides, it makes
sex more pleasurable.

219
00:08:07,596 --> 00:08:10,596
Yeah. So how does
that help me?

220
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:11,729
George,
you ever see one?

221
00:08:11,762 --> 00:08:13,296
Yeah. My roommate
in college.

222
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:13,669
Yeah?
What did you think?

223
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:15,096
Yeah?
What did you think?

224
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:16,929
I got used to it.

225
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:22,829
I want to see the pig-man.
Show me the pig-man.

226
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:24,496
Oh, don't worry.
I'm going to show you.

227
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:25,762
and you'll never
be the same.

228
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,896
Maybe he's just a guy
with a nose like this.

229
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:29,796
You know a lot of people
have a nose like this.

230
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:31,429
They're not
necessarily pig-men.

231
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:33,896
Believe me, Jerry.
Somewhere in this hospital,

232
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,962
the anguished oink of pig-man
cries out for help!

233
00:08:36,996 --> 00:08:39,996
Well, if I hear an anguished
oink, I'm out of here.

234
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:41,996
I don't see any pig-men.

235
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:43,669
I see human, human,

236
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,396
I see human, human,

237
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:45,396
human.

238
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:46,829
Wait a second!
What?

239
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:48,196
Oh. It's George.

240
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,296
The administrator's
on the third floor,

241
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:52,829
so I'll meet you guys
back at the car.

242
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:56,329
Wait, George. You got room in
the car for the pig-man, huh?

243
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:58,796
The pig-man
can take the bus.

244
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,296
George, if the pig-man had a
car, he would give you a ride.

245
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:04,229
How do you know?

246
00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:06,229
What if the pig-man
had a two-seater?

247
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:07,696
Be realistic, George.

248
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:12,062
I'll tell you what.

249
00:09:12,096 --> 00:09:13,669
If pig-man shows up,
we'll squeeze him in.

250
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:14,596
If pig-man shows up,
we'll squeeze him in.

251
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:17,429
I'll see you later.

252
00:09:17,903 --> 00:09:21,270
Mr. Costanza,
come in. Come in.

253
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:24,603
It's been a very trying couple
of days around the hospital.

254
00:09:24,637 --> 00:09:28,570
Doctors, patients,
everyone just grief-stricken

255
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:30,603
over this
unfortunate occurrence.

256
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,670
Well, I join them
in their grief.

257
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:34,603
Horrible thing!

258
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:38,103
Flew right past
the children's wing.

259
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:41,703
All the sick children in the
playroom looking out the window

260
00:09:41,737 --> 00:09:43,669
just traumatized
by the incident.

261
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:44,837
just traumatized
by the incident.

262
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,837
Apparently, they thought
he was flying.

263
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,603
You know how
children are.

264
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:52,070
"Oh, look, a man is flying!
A man is flying!"

265
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:54,570
And then...splat.

266
00:09:54,603 --> 00:09:59,570
That's where I come in,
um...on splat.

267
00:09:59,603 --> 00:10:01,603
You see,
Mrs. Sweedler--

268
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:03,503
or is it Hospital
Administrator Sweedler?

269
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:04,537
Mrs. Sweedler.

270
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,037
Mrs. Sweedler.
Thank you very much.

271
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,303
You see, this tragedy
has affected me in a very...

272
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,669
very personal way.

273
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:13,703
very personal way.

274
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:15,170
How is that?

275
00:10:15,203 --> 00:10:16,170
Yes, well,

276
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:17,203
you see...

277
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,403
the deceased...

278
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:21,603
landed on my car.

279
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:25,503
The splat, as it were,

280
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:28,237
actually occurred
on the roof of my car.

281
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,537
Now, of course,
I can't help but feel

282
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,937
that had it been
a convertible,

283
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,037
this whole tragedy
might have been averted.

284
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,337
But I've never really been

285
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,937
the kind of guy
to buy a convertible,

286
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,537
what with the baldness
and everything.

287
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,669
Well, I have known bald men
who owned convertibles.

288
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:46,603
Well, I have known bald men
who owned convertibles.

289
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:47,903
They wore a hat.

290
00:10:47,937 --> 00:10:51,503
Yes, but then everything's
all pulled down, and--

291
00:10:51,537 --> 00:10:53,337
Ah, Anyway.

292
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,903
The damage,
unfortunately, has...

293
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:59,603
marred an otherwise
fine automobile,

294
00:10:59,637 --> 00:11:02,437
rendering it
virtually undrivable.

295
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,903
Yes. Well,
that is a shame.

296
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:09,003
Yes! A shame. That is exactly
how I would put it.

297
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:13,337
Now, Mrs. Sweedler, with all due
discretion and sensitivity,

298
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:13,669
and taking in the whole
scope of the situation,

299
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:17,170
and taking in the whole
scope of the situation,

300
00:11:17,203 --> 00:11:19,870
I just can't help
but think that...

301
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:23,037
the hospital
is somehow responsible

302
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,937
for compensating the other
still living victim

303
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,370
of this horrendous,
horrendous tragedy.

304
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:32,770
Mr. Costanza,
Yes?

305
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:37,270
a man plummeted tragically
to his ultimate demise, Yes.

306
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:41,603
and you greedily, callously
want to profit from it?

307
00:11:41,637 --> 00:11:43,669
Well, "profit"?
I--

308
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,770
Well, "profit"?
I--

309
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:46,570
I think you'll see
from the estimate

310
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:50,570
that I'm not really
profiting that much.

311
00:11:50,603 --> 00:11:52,103
It might be
a little high, but--

312
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:53,537
Get out.

313
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,637
Get out now.
Get out of my office!

314
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,237
Should I
just leave--?

315
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,437
Get out!

316
00:12:03,037 --> 00:12:04,037
This is it.

317
00:12:13,603 --> 00:12:13,669
KRAMER:
Uh, wait. Uh, excuse me.

318
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:15,037
KRAMER:
Uh, wait. Uh, excuse me.

319
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,570
What happened to the guy
that was in there before?

320
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,403
I don't know what
you're talking about.

321
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:21,603
No, you know. This.

322
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,770
No...

323
00:12:24,803 --> 00:12:26,270
This doesn't look
familiar to you?

324
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:27,270
Uh, sir, uh--

325
00:12:27,303 --> 00:12:28,270
Wait, now, look, look.

326
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:31,203
I know
what's going on.

327
00:12:31,237 --> 00:12:33,070
The oink, oink?

328
00:12:33,103 --> 00:12:36,003
Yes, well If you'll excuse me.
I have some patients I really--

329
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:37,570
Now, listen to me,
you little quack!

330
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:40,003
There was a half-man, half-pig
in that room over there!

331
00:12:40,037 --> 00:12:41,903
Now, where is he?
Where is he?!

332
00:12:41,937 --> 00:12:42,937
Half what?

333
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,669
You know what I mean!
Pork! Sausage!

334
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:45,503
You know what I mean!
Pork! Sausage!

335
00:12:45,537 --> 00:12:48,870
"Abdee-abdee--
that's all folks!"

336
00:12:48,903 --> 00:12:52,037
I think he's been
released.

337
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:55,037
Ugh.

338
00:12:56,203 --> 00:12:57,537
He's lying!

339
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,037
All right, Kramer.
Enough of this.

340
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,037
I gotta go
find George.

341
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,003
All right.
You go ahead.

342
00:13:02,037 --> 00:13:03,037
Kramer.

343
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:09,537
[♪]

344
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,603
Where's the <i>mohel?</i>

345
00:13:10,637 --> 00:13:11,603
He'll be here.

346
00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:12,903

00:18:59,937 --> 00:19:02,170
You see?
He flinched again!

517
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:04,537
Nice <i>mohel</i> picking Elaine.
You picked a hell of a <i>mohel!</i>

518
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:04,867
One more peep, I'll slice you
like a smoked sturgeon!

519
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:06,837
One more peep, I'll slice you
like a smoked sturgeon!

520
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,370
Don't threaten me,
butcher boy!

521
00:19:08,403 --> 00:19:09,870
Butcher boy?

522
00:19:09,903 --> 00:19:11,670
Yeah, what was this?

523
00:19:11,703 --> 00:19:13,670
What was this?

524
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:14,737
It was
your fault!

525
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,103
Jerry, the <i>mohel's</i>
got a knife!

526
00:19:16,137 --> 00:19:18,170
Hey, what's going on
out here?

527
00:19:18,203 --> 00:19:20,270
You should be ashamed
of yourself! The both of ya!

528
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:22,337
Ah! Blood!

529
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,503
Oh, How's the baby?

530
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,103
There's nothing wrong
with the baby.

531
00:19:25,137 --> 00:19:26,670
The circumcision
went fine.

532
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:30,103
Thank God the flincher
didn't harm the baby!

533
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:31,103
I'll get you
for this!

534
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,670
This is my business!
This is my life.

535
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:34,867
No one ruins it
for me! No one!

536
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:34,937
No one ruins it
for me! No one!

537
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:35,970
Here's my card.

538
00:19:37,037 --> 00:19:38,303
KRAMER:
Get out of my way!

[SNORTING]

540
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:53,070
I can't do it.

541
00:19:53,103 --> 00:19:55,603
[AS DON CORLEONE]
Look what they did to my boy.

542
00:19:55,637 --> 00:19:57,837
They massacred my boy.

543
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,737
You really do the worst
Godfather I've ever heard.

544
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,337
You're not even close.

545
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,337
Ahh.

[BUZZING]

Oh, that's the
Flicks.

548
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:06,670
Oh, that's the
Flicks.

549
00:20:06,703 --> 00:20:08,770
It's a '76
Chevy Impala.

550
00:20:08,803 --> 00:20:11,603
No, they stole it right
in front of the hospital.

551
00:20:11,637 --> 00:20:14,837
I saw the guy
drive off in it.

552
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,603
Well, he's about 5 feet tall,

553
00:20:18,637 --> 00:20:21,437
hairless,
pink complexion.

554
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,670
Looks like a pig.

555
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:27,270
Yeah. All right.
Thank you.

556
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:29,437
Yeah.

557
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:32,037
So...

558
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,003
Any word from
the pig-man?

559
00:20:34,037 --> 00:20:34,867
No.

560
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:35,070
No.

561
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:39,403
No. And he's not
a pig-man, is he?

562
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:40,837
No, he's not.

563
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,937
He's just a fat,
little mental-patient.

564
00:20:45,437 --> 00:20:46,737
Myra, Stan.

565
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,403
Don't touch him!

566
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:49,737
What's
the matter?

567
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,903
You're out as godfather.
You too. You're both out.

568
00:20:51,937 --> 00:20:53,903
But I didn't do--
No! No "buts."

569
00:20:53,937 --> 00:20:56,537
We've made up our minds.

570
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,737
We want Kramer.

571
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,937
He showed us how much
he cares about Steven.

Don't ever go against the family, Jerry.

573

[AS DON CORLEONE]
Don't ever go against the family, Jerry.

[♪]

575
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,537
Godfather.

576
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,537
Godfather.

577
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,570
Yes.

578
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:35,021
To me what's really amazing,
that for every job there is

579
00:21:35,054 --> 00:21:38,521
in the world, there's
someone willing to do it.

580
00:21:38,554 --> 00:21:41,321
Someone goes: "Yes, I will stand
in the tunnel breathing exhaust

581
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:44,187
fumes, watching the cars go by,
making sure everything's okay."

582
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:46,387
Someone goes: "Yes, I will
work behind the elephant

583
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:48,421
with the big shovel.
I will do it."

584
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:51,987
Doctors go: "Yes, I will confine
myself to one particularly

585
00:21:52,021 --> 00:21:56,487
"objectionable part of the human
body all day, every day.

586
00:21:56,521 --> 00:21:58,721
I will do it."

587
00:21:58,754 --> 00:22:00,754
I think a lot of people
that are unemployed

588
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:01,499
are not really unable
to find work,

589
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:02,987
are not really unable
to find work,

590
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,054
they're just easily
disgusted.

591
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:08,387
"Yes, I'm starving and my family
has no clothing or shelter,

592
00:22:08,421 --> 00:22:11,021
but I'm not cleaning
that up."
