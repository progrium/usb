1
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:03,900
The love seat is an interesting
little item there.

2
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:06,533
I guess some guy thought, "If we
can't get them to sit closer,

3
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:08,200
why not just shorten
the furniture?"

4
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:11,533
My other favorite
furniture brand is the La-Z-Boy.

5
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:14,000
This is very flattering
to the prospective customer,

6
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:15,500
isn't it?

7
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:17,866
Why don't we just call it
"the half-conscious dead beat

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,400
with no job, home all day,
eating Cheetos

9
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:23,833
and watching TV" recliner.

10
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:26,733
And it goes back so far,
that thing.

11
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:29,900
I mean, go to bed already.
It's over. You're wiped.

12
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:37,900
JERRY:
So she got you to join a book club?

13
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:39,233
I got a feeling
I'm gonna be

14
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:42,400
much smarter than you
pretty soon.

15
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:44,033
Well, I think
that statement alone

16
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:47,233
reflects your burgeoning
intelligence.

17
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:48,400
Hey, what about
this one?

18
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:49,733
No, I don't like
that one.

19
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:50,966
So, what's your first book?

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,366
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>
90 pages.

21
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,833
It's kind of old, isn't it?

22
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:59,066
They wanted to read
a Truman Capote book.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,833
Oh, sure.
Truman Capote.

24
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:02,500
Yeah, he's a great writer.
Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:02,699
Did you ever
read anything by him?

26
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,000
Did you ever
read anything by him?

27
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:05,000
No, you?

28
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:06,433
Nah.

29
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,500
Oh, what about
this one?

30
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,400
Look at this.
This is it.

31
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:14,300
This is what
I'm looking for.

32
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,733
Oh, yeah.

33
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:18,300
ELAINE:
Hey, what's going on?

34
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,300
New couch,
baby.

35
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,466
New couch?
Why?

36
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,566
I love this couch.

37
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,233
You know what
the best part about it is?

38
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:26,766
It doesn't fold out,
so no one can sleep over.

39
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:30,633
Hello.

40
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,699
Hello.

41
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:33,300
Hello.

42
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,666
Oh, let me
get the door for you.

43
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,033
Ooh, be careful,
be careful.

44
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,133
Wait till
you see it.

45
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,200
It's perfect.

46
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:43,633
The guy told me
it's one of a kind.

47
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,200
They stopped
making it.

48
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,866
What are you doing
with your old couch?

49
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,533
Nothing, the moving guys
are taking it.

50
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,400
Why, you want it?
Yeah, I'll take it.

51
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:52,566
Oh, I'm sure they can
deliver it to your apartment.

52
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,100
Yes, they can.

53
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,066
Hey, couch
is coming?

54
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,066
It's here.

55
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,400
All right,
yeah.

56
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:01,166
You know, I'm excited
about this, Jerry.

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,699
In a way I feel like
I'm getting a new couch.

58
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:03,066
In a way I feel like
I'm getting a new couch.

59
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,766
Yeah, so do I.

60
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,300
Ooh, you remember
Poppie?

61
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,300
Oh, you mean
from Poppie's Restaurant?

62
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,900
Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh, we're
going into business together.

63
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:13,700
You remember that idea
I had a few years ago

64
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,900
about the pizza place
where you make your own pizza?

65
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:17,066
Yeah.
What was that again?

66
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,066
It's a pizza place

67
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,833
where you make
your own pie.

68
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:22,333
We give you the dough,
the sauce, the cheese.

69
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:26,700
You pound it, slap it.
You flip it up into the air,

70
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:30,533
put your toppings on,
and you slide it into oven.

71
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:32,333
Sounds good, huh?

72
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:32,699
[SOUTHERN ACCENT]
Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella

73
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,566
[SOUTHERN ACCENT]
Ooh, I can't wait to get me a fella

74
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,700
and make my own pie.

75
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:38,666
What made you resurrect
that old idea?

76
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,033
Well, I happened to be
eating at Poppie's

77
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:42,966
when I told him
the old idea,

78
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,633
and his eyes...
just lit up.

79
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,966
You know, he wants
to back it.

80
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,233
I heard Poppie's
was good.

81
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:50,400
Let's go.
I'm not going there.

82
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:52,300
Didn't he get busted
by the board of health?

83
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,033
Well, that was
in the past, Jerry.

84
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:56,233
As it happens,
<i>New York</i> magazine

85
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,833
just judged
his kitchen

86
00:02:57,866 --> 00:02:59,500
to be one of the cleanest
in the city.

87
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:00,500
They got a duck there--

88
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,699
You think you died
and went to heaven.

89
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:02,700
You think you died
and went to heaven.

90
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,866
Ooh, I love duck.

91
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,000
Come on, come on.

92
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:07,866
Well, you gotta order it
two days in advance.

93
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,166
You know,
I'm gonna call him.

94
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,633
I'm gonna order
the duck for you.

95
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,933
Oh, Kramer--

96
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:18,700
Right there,
guys.

97
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,166
That's perfect.

98
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,166
Huh?

99
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,000
What do you think,
Lainie?

100
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:24,000
Well,
I don't know.

101
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:25,166
I'll have to
sit on it.

102
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,400
Oh no, I don't want
anyone sitting on it.

103
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:29,966
Sign here.

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,066
Excuse me.

105
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,699
Um, I was wondering
if it would be possible

106
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:33,333
Um, I was wondering
if it would be possible

107
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:34,800
if you could deliver
the old couch

108
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,533
to my apartment.
It's not very far.

109
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:38,500
Sure.
Okay.

110
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:40,800
You, uh-- You got room
in the truck for me?

111
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,533
Uh, heh, heh.

112
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,066
Yeah, I think we can
squeeze you in.

113
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,033
Oh, goody.
Okay.

114
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:47,166
Well, uh...

115
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,666
I'll see you chumps later.

116
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,300
Did you offer those guys
a drink?

117
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,300
Uh, no.
Should I have?

118
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,666
What kind
of a person are you?

119
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,500
I don't know.

120
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:02,666
GEORGE:
Okay. <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,966
So, he puts
the couch down,

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,366
and just as he's
about to leave,

123
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,666
he says,
"Do you date moving men?"

124
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,633
Uh-huh.

125
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,900
You wanna know
what I said?

126
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:29,466
Oh, I can't wait.

127
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,533
"I do now."

128
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:32,699
Clever.
Is that something?

129
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,000
Clever.
Is that something?

130
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:35,133
Yes.
Is that something?

131
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,033
You're something.

132
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,533
So, anyway, when they were
in my house before--

133
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:41,666
Yeah?

134
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,800
--I didn't offer them
anything to drink.

135
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,700
Well, they're real men, Jerry.
They get sweaty.

136
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,400
So anyone sweaty
comes into your house

137
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:49,533
has to be offered
a drink?

138
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:51,166
Yes.

139
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,166
Well, would you
apologize for me.

140
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,466
Mm-hm.

141
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,900
Hello.

142
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:58,133
Jerry, so good
to see you again.

143
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:02,066
Hello...Poppie.

144
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,699
This is Elaine.

145
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:03,133
This is Elaine.

146
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,966
Nice to meet you,
Poppie.

147
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,400
Let me show you
to your table, huh?

148
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:07,533
Okay.

149
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:10,800
Your duck is a-cookin'
as we speak.

150
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:14,833
It is so succulent,
so succulent.

151
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:17,666
Well, Kramer told us all about
your business venture together.

152
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,700
Your friend and I are gonna
make a lot of money, huh?

153
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:21,866
Ha, ha.

154
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,300
Of course, I already have
a lot of money.

155
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,233
Poppie does very well.

156
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:28,566
Very well.

157
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:32,699
Well, your mother must be
very proud of you.

158
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,500
Well, your mother must be
very proud of you.

159
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:39,566
My mother was taken
from my house

160
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,000
by the communists
in the middle of the night

161
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:44,500
when I was 10 years old.

162
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:47,333
She was sent
to a slave labor camp,

163
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:50,533
where she labored
for 12 years.

164
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:53,466
Finally,
they released her,

165
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,533
and she was
on a boat to America

166
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:57,533
to reunite with us.

167
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,066
But she was served
some bad fish,

168
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,699
and she died
on the high seas.

169
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:03,766
and she died
on the high seas.

170
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,233
So, what's good
tonight?

171
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,333
Boy, I'm really
looking forward

172
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:25,400
to this duck.

173
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:26,400
I've never had food

174
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:28,466
ordered in advance before.

175
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,666
Meh, I could have stayed home

176

Yeah, she was
a delicate flower.

Why didn't you just
read the book?

433
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:19,008

I felt this way.

he doing here?

Come on,

It's not your seat.

00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:14,475
I was-- I was
sitting there, come on.

turn the cushion over.
