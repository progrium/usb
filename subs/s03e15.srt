177
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,642
I wanted to see
what time it was.

178
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:19,842
Are you afraid of him?

179
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,708
No.
Then kiss me.

180
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,542
Here?
Yes, right here.

181
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,542
Is this the proper venue?

182
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:27,875
You don't want to?

183
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:29,042
No, no, I want to.

184
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:29,768
I very much want to.
I desire to. I pine to.

185
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:32,475
I very much want to.
I desire to. I pine to.

186
00:07:32,508 --> 00:07:34,308
Then kiss me
right in front of him.

187
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:37,142
I can't! What if he wakes up?

188
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:40,075
A man is lying here unconscious
and you're afraid of him?

189
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:42,708
What kind of a man are you?

190
00:07:42,742 --> 00:07:45,742
I'm a man who respects
a good coma.

191
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,242
If it was one of those
in-and-out comas, maybe.

192
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:54,542
But when a guy's got a coma
going like this...

193
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:57,075
you don't wanna mess with it.

194
00:07:57,775 --> 00:07:59,675
[♪]

195
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:01,808
Hey.

196
00:08:01,842 --> 00:08:02,808
Hey.

197
00:08:02,842 --> 00:08:04,075
Did you hear about Martin?

198
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,708
Yeah, I heard.

199
00:08:05,742 --> 00:08:08,875
I can't believe he's in a coma.
He's got my vacuum cleaner.

200
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,875
I loaned it to him,
he never returned it.

201
00:08:13,908 --> 00:08:15,842
The carpets are filthy.

202
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,042
What am I gonna do?

203
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:18,908
Who told you about Martin?

204
00:08:18,942 --> 00:08:21,042
Newman.
He's good friends with him.

205
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:23,875
Oh. Bigmouth Newman.
I should have guessed.

206
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:27,342
He's got all my attachments,
you know.

207
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,768
Let me ask you something.
How long do you have to wait

208
00:08:29,768 --> 00:08:30,042
Let me ask you something.
How long do you have to wait

209
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:32,075
for a guy to come out of a coma

210
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:33,742
before you ask
his ex-girlfriend out?

211
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:35,808
Oh, Gina?

212
00:08:35,842 --> 00:08:39,275
Why wait?
Why not just call Dr. Kevorkian.

213
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:44,308
I don't get that
whole suicide machine.

214
00:08:44,342 --> 00:08:47,308
There's no tall buildings
where these people live?

215
00:08:47,342 --> 00:08:48,875
They can't wrap their lips

216
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:51,708
around a revolver
like a normal person?

217
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:53,975
What's going on
between you and Gina?

218
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:56,808
Well, I went with her
to the hospital last night.

219
00:08:56,842 --> 00:08:59,768
So we're in the room and she's
trying to get me to kiss her

220
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:00,042
So we're in the room and she's
trying to get me to kiss her

221
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:01,508
right in front of him.

222
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,642
That's the great thing
about Mediterranean women.

223
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:05,108
All right. So, what did you do?

224
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,342
Nothing.

225
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,208
What kind of a man are you?

226
00:09:11,242 --> 00:09:12,908
The guy is unconscious,
in a coma

227
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:15,208
and you don't have the guts
to kiss his girlfriend?

228
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:18,642
I didn't know what
the coma etiquette was.

229
00:09:18,675 --> 00:09:20,675
There is no coma etiquette.

230
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,375
See, that's the beauty
of the coma.

231
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:25,175
It doesn't matter what
you do around it.

232
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,042
So you're saying his girl,
his car, his clothes,

233
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:29,768
it's all up for
grabs.

234
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:30,475
it's all up for
grabs.

235
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:32,342
You can just loot
the coma victim.

236
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:36,508
I give them 24 hours
to get out of it.

237
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:40,242
They can't get out of it
by 24 hours, it's a land rush.

238
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:44,708
So if the coma victim wakes
up in a month...

239
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:47,142
he's thrilled. He got out
of the coma.

240
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:48,475
He goes home,
there's nothing left?

241
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:50,042
Nothing left!

242
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:54,408
That's why I'm trying
to get that vacuum.

243
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:55,942
Because somebody's
gonna grab it.

244
00:09:59,242 --> 00:09:59,768
[♪]

245
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:00,575
[♪]

246
00:10:01,942 --> 00:10:05,308
Martin's spirit came
to you as a warning.

247
00:10:05,342 --> 00:10:07,008
Why would he come to George?

248
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:10,075
Because George has heightened
extrasensory perception.

249
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,708
Faithy, get your finger
out of your nose!

250
00:10:11,742 --> 00:10:14,508
I knew it.
I always felt different.

251
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:15,908
You are. Some coffee cake?

252
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:16,908
Drake's?

253
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:17,908
Yes.

254
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:20,342
Did you buy this for me?

255
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,475
No, why?

256
00:10:21,508 --> 00:10:24,842
Because I love
Drake's Coffee Cake.

257
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,175
Maybe I did.

258
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,908
Take it away.

259
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:29,768
She hasn't eaten in two days.

260
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:30,175
She hasn't eaten in two days.

261
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,308
Who's Pauline?

262
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:33,875
Pauline?

263
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:36,075
Wait a minute. Oh, my God.

264
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:39,408
My brother once impregnated
a woman named Pauline.

265
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:40,542
You think about her?

266
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:42,542
When I hear her name.

267
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,275
Cut these with your left hand.

268
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:51,908
There was a woman. Audrey.

269
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,042
She had a very big nose.

270
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:56,908
I see an Audrey,
but with a small nose.

271
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:59,768
Yes, yes. She had a nose job.

272
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:00,008
Yes, yes. She had a nose job.

273
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,742
I loved her very deeply.

274
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,375
Will she ever speak to me again?

275
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:06,808
Not in this life.

276
00:11:06,842 --> 00:11:08,708
Should you be smoking?

277
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:10,542
Does it bother you?

278
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:11,542
You're pregnant.

279
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:12,542
Elaine.

280
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:16,008
I smoked when I had Faithy.
Uh-oh.

281
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,075
What? What?

282
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:20,342
I don't know about this trip,
George.

283
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,408
You can see the Cayman Islands
in there?

284
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:24,375
Is something gonna happen
to me? What?

285
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:27,008
It's really bad for the fetus,
you know that?

286
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:29,375
She's a psychic. She knows
how the kid's gonna be.

287
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:29,768
Should I not go on this trip?

288
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:32,242
Should I not go on this trip?

289
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,375
George...

290
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:35,208
I am going to tell you
something

291
00:11:35,242 --> 00:11:38,708
and I want you
to really hear me.

292
00:11:38,742 --> 00:11:41,708
Now, listen, I just don't know
how a person, with everything

293
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,575
we now know about prenatal care,

294
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:47,808
can put a cigarette
in her mouth!

295
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:49,342
What are you doing to me?

296
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,542
It's disgusting.

297
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:51,742
I don't need this!

298
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:52,742
Look, please!

299
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:54,175
I would like you both to leave.

300
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,342
Oh, fine.

301
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,008
Well, I don't like
to be around people

302
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:58,042
who are just so irresponsible.

303
00:11:58,075 --> 00:11:59,308
Get the hell out.

304
00:11:59,342 --> 00:11:59,768
A plane crash?!
A heart attack?!

305
00:11:59,768 --> 00:12:01,875
A plane crash?!
A heart attack?!

306
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:03,242
Lupus? Is it lupus?

307
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:05,075
Do you want me
to call the super?

308
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:07,175
He was an Israeli commando.

309
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:12,008
If you don't say anything,
I'll assume it's a plane crash.

310
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:13,342
Get out.

311
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,808
Not a plane crash.

312
00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:18,608
Is it a plane crash?

313
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:21,208
Psychics should be licensed.

314
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:22,508
And it wouldn't be hard.

315
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,642
We could just give them
the regular DMV test

316
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:28,075
only with the silver dollars and
the pizza dough over the eyes.

317
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:29,768
If you can do the parallel park
like that, you're a psychic.

318
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:31,408
If you can do the parallel park
like that, you're a psychic.

319
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:34,042
We can test these people,
no question about it.

320
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:37,175
Like Kreskin. Instead
of just hiding his check...

321
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,375
why don't we try
stopping his check.

322
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:42,875
Let's see how he handles that.

323
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:46,875
I do not like your toothbrush.

324
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:48,008
There are no bristles.

325
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:51,742
You can say what you want
about me...

326
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:54,208
but I'll be damned
if I'm gonna stand here

327
00:12:54,242 --> 00:12:56,008
while you insult my
toothbrush.

328
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:59,768
It is too small for someone
with such a big mouth.

329
00:12:59,768 --> 00:13:00,908
It is too small for someone
with such a big mouth.

330
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,642
Let me ask you...

331
00:13:05,675 --> 00:13:12,042
what will you do if Martin
wakes up? Run away like a mouse?

332
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:16,375
No, more like the Three Stooges
at the end of every movie.

333
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:19,042
Who are these stooges
you speak of?

334
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:21,642
They're a comedy team.

335
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,708
Tell me about them. Everything.

336
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:26,208
Well, they're three
funny-looking guys

337
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:29,242
and they'd hit each other a lot.

338
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:31,508
You will show me the stooges?

339
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:34,575
I will show you the stooges.

340
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:36,075
When?

341
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:37,542
Well...

342
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:40,508
I don't really know where
the stooges are right now...

343
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,908
but if I locate them,
you'll be the first to know.

344
00:13:42,942 --> 00:13:47,875
Come. You walk me to a cab.

345
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:50,042
Well, I....

346
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:52,742
I don't want you to get upset
or anything...

347
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:54,975
but with Martin and all,
maybe it's not a good idea

348
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:56,642
to be seen together...

349
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:59,075
in the building,
because he had a lot of friends.

350
00:13:59,108 --> 00:13:59,768
You are still afraid.
You are not a man.

351
00:13:59,768 --> 00:14:01,642
You are still afraid.
You are not a man.

352
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,375
Well, then what
are all those ties

353
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:05,842
and sports jackets doing
in my closet?

354
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,375
Are you going to walk me
to a cab or not?

355
00:14:08,408 --> 00:14:10,408
Yeah, all right, all right.

356
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,708
Why don't you just eat fruit.

357
00:14:18,742 --> 00:14:20,342
Fruit makes me incontinent.

358
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,242
I don't want you eating
over here.

359
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:25,208
Hello, Gina. Hello, Jerry.

360
00:14:25,242 --> 00:14:27,775
Hello, Newman.

361
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:34,175
[♪]

362
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,908
Do you think Newman would
tell Martin if he wakes up?

363
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:42,542
What kind of sicko would do
that? He could kill me.

364
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:44,708
People smoke, Elaine.

365
00:14:44,742 --> 00:14:47,308
My mother smoked.

366
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:49,675
It didn't hurt me.

367
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:54,208
Did you guys see that wall move?

368
00:14:54,242 --> 00:14:57,242
Boy, it's a good thing we came.

369
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,875
Could there be a native problem
in the Caymans?

370
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:01,287
Maybe there's native unrest.

371
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:01,375
Maybe there's native unrest.

372
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:05,375
Hi. I haven't eaten
in three days.

373
00:15:05,408 --> 00:15:09,142
I was wondering how much longer
it would be till I get my X-ray.

374
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,808
We'll call you.

375
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:12,742
George, I want you to promise
me something.

376
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:14,908
If I'm ever in a coma

377
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:17,475
in the first 24 hours, get
everything out of my place

378
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:20,875
and put it in storage.

379
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:21,875
How come?

380
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:23,275
Looters.

381
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:27,108
How do we know
the dog food's any good?

382
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:31,287
Who tastes it?

383
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:32,342
Who tastes it?

384
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,242
She is really hungry.

385
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:36,375
Hey.

386
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:37,742
Kramer.

387
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:41,008
Well, Newman's upstairs
visiting Martin.

388
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:45,208
Would you buy
my Cayman Island ticket?

389
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:46,342
You're not going?

390
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,342
No.

391
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,575
Why not?

392
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:51,075
The psychic said something
terrible will happen.

393
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:54,242
I dig.

394
00:15:56,242 --> 00:15:57,508
[♪]

395
00:15:57,542 --> 00:16:00,342
I want my vacuum cleaner!

396
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,287
Martin, I know you can hear me.

397
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:02,742
Martin, I know you can hear me.

398
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,342
Look, my mother's coming
to visit me.

399
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,675
She sees that rug,
she's gonna kill me.

400
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,242
He can't hear you, you idiot.

401
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:11,075
Why don't you
just buy another one.

402
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:14,808
Why would I buy another one when
I spent 100 bucks on this one?

403
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:17,175
I have a carpet sweeper
you can use.

404
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,708
I don't want a carpet sweeper.
They don't do anything.

405
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:22,342
It gets my rug clean.

406
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,342
The carpet sweeper
is the biggest scam perpetrated

407
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:29,008
on the American public
since One Hour Martinizing.

408
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:30,875
You should take a look
at my rug, then.

409
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:31,287
I wouldn't set foot
in your house.

410
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:33,275
I wouldn't set foot
in your house.

411
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:37,008
Hello.
Hey.

412
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:38,175
Hello, Jerry.

413
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,208
How's he doing?

414
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:44,642
Well, he looks happy to me.

415
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:48,342
I hope he stays this happy
when he wakes up.

416
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,475
Why wouldn't he?

417
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,208
No reason.

418
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:54,242
He'll have a lot of catching up
to do, I guess.

419
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:56,875
I'll bring him up to date.

420
00:16:56,908 --> 00:16:58,342
How up to date?

421
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,742
All the way up.

422
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:03,242
Nothing could change your mind?

423
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:05,208
Well, it would take a lot,

424
00:17:05,242 --> 00:17:09,208
because a friend
is something you earn.

425
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:10,908
Jerry has a friend
who has free tickets

426
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:13,908
to the Cayman Islands
this weekend.

427
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:16,375
KRAMER: He's not going.

428
00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:19,908
I don't care much for the beach.
I freckle.

429
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,542
Is that a...?

430
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:29,242
Drake's Coffee Cake.

431
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:31,287
Wow. Where did you get that?

432
00:17:31,287 --> 00:17:32,742
Wow. Where did you get that?

433
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:37,308
From my house.
I got a whole box of them.

434
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:40,808
Boy. That's the full-size.

435
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,842
That's your big boy.

436
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:46,275
Can I have a bite?

437
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,708
I don't like to give out bites.

438
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:51,875
I got another one...

439
00:17:51,908 --> 00:17:54,075
but I'm saving it for later.

440
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,842
Just one bite?

441
00:17:58,275 --> 00:18:01,287
I don't think so.
You know, they're so fragile.

442
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:01,808
I don't think so.
You know, they're so fragile.

443
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:04,908
All right! All right.

444
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:06,242
I won't say anything.

445
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:07,242
You swear?

446
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:08,575
I swear.

447
00:18:08,608 --> 00:18:10,142
On your mother's life?

448
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:11,842
On my mother's life.

449
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,408
Ooooh.

450
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:22,675
Ohhh.

451
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,375
But here it was...

452
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:29,242
mountains of duck.

453
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,287
And not fatty duck either, but
juicy, tender breasts of duck.

454
00:18:31,287 --> 00:18:35,875
And not fatty duck either, but
juicy, tender breasts of duck.

455
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:36,975
Beautifully sliced....

456
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:37,975
Faithy!

457
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:39,642
Sweetheart, no, don't run!

458
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:41,742
ELAINE: You could take
as much as you want....

459
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:47,608
Sweetheart! Sweetheart! Faithy!

460
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:54,042
Hi. Hi! What are you doing here?
How did I know you were here?

461
00:18:54,075 --> 00:18:58,142
Something drew me here.
This is phenomenal.

462
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,675
The nurse said
she'd be right back.

463
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,287
Supposed to take me
to the delivery room.

464
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:01,575
Supposed to take me
to the delivery room.

465
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:04,208
Oh, that's great. That's great.

466
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:07,008
By the way, I have to apologize
for my friend the other day--

467
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:08,542
Friend? I don't even
know that woman.

468
00:19:08,575 --> 00:19:12,042
I met her on the bus on the way
over. I couldn't get rid of her.

469
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:14,508
I tell you, my psychic instincts
were a little off--

470
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:15,508
[GROANS]

471
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:16,542
Where's the nurse?

472
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:18,675
I'm sure she'll be right back.

473
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,708
Sweetheart, why don't you
run and get a nurse for Mommy.

474
00:19:21,742 --> 00:19:23,475
I was just curious.
The other day

475
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:25,375
you said something
about my trip.

476
00:19:25,408 --> 00:19:26,475
Don't take that trip.

477
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:27,675
Yeah! Why? Why?

478
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,075
Because.... Because....

479
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:31,287
All right, Rula.
It's time to go.

480
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:32,008
All right, Rula.
It's time to go.

481
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,608
Yeah, because...? Because...?

482
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:39,575
Assassins! How dare they keep
a person waiting like this!

483
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:43,575
Drake's Coffee Cake?

484
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:44,875
Give me that!

485
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:46,475
Jerry, you better stop her or
I'll tell!

486
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:50,375
Elaine, no! No!

[GROAN]

488
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:54,308
Are there terrorists
on the plane?

489
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:56,542
A hotel fire, is that it?

490
00:19:56,575 --> 00:20:00,708
Typhus? Malaria? Yellow fever?
Lupus? Is it lupus?

491
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:01,287
They did it right in this bed,
Martin. Right in front of you.

492
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:03,308
They did it right in this bed,
Martin. Right in front of you.

493
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:04,642
I want my vacuum cleaner!

494
00:20:04,675 --> 00:20:06,142
I can explain!

495
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:07,342
It was disgusting!

496
00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:16,542
What are you doing? We're
going to dinner in 10 minutes.

497
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:20,342
I never assisted in a birth
before.

498
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,175
It's really quite disgusting.

499
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,475
What did she name the kid?

500
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:25,175
You wouldn't believe it.

501
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,008

00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:30,142
Hey!

00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:31,287
Hey!

504
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:32,042
Hey!

505
00:20:32,075 --> 00:20:33,342
When did you get back?

506
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,142
A couple hours ago.

507
00:20:35,175 --> 00:20:36,175
So how was it?

508
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,175
George...

509
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,642
I would like to thank you

510
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:43,908
for the greatest four days
of my life.

511
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:47,642
They were shooting the <i>Sports</i>
<i>Illustrated</i> swimsuit issue

512
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:51,342
right in the hotel pool.
Not only that

513
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,342
the hotel opened up an area
on the beach for nude bathing

514
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,908
and all of the models
went down there.

515
00:20:55,942 --> 00:20:58,075
Wow!

516
00:20:58,108 --> 00:21:00,642
I am on the next blanket
from Elle Macpherson.

517
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:01,287
Oh!

518
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:02,242
Oh!

519
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:04,008
We played backgammon nude.

520
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:05,008
Oh!

521
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:06,242
Oh, she's a sweet kid.

522
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:08,142
Nude backgammon...

523
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:10,742
with swimsuit models!

524
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:13,175
Oh, you know what?
The second day I was there,

525
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,708
I stepped on a jellyfish.

526
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:16,642
It kinda stung my foot.

527
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,175
That's probably what Rula
was trying to warn you about.

528
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,975
You gotta watch
for the jellyfish.

529
00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:23,508
Yeah.

530
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:24,975
What's this?

531
00:21:25,008 --> 00:21:26,175
It's an invitation
to a housewarming

532
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,308
for Martin and Gina.

533
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:29,742
They moved in together?

534
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:31,287
Yeah, some place in the Village.

535
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:31,842
Yeah, some place in the Village.

536
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,542
[INTERCOM BUZZES]

537
00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:35,375
Yeah.

538
00:21:35,408 --> 00:21:37,208
<i>It's Elaine.</i>

539
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:38,808
All right, we're coming down.

540
00:21:38,842 --> 00:21:40,042
Where you going?

541
00:21:40,075 --> 00:21:41,808
We're taking Elaine to dinner.

542
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,808
She's gotta start the fast
again. You wanna go?

543
00:21:44,842 --> 00:21:47,075
I'd like to, but a bunch of us
from the islands

544
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:48,142
are getting together.

545
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:49,808
Elle Macpherson gonna be there?

546
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,442
I gotta call her back.

547
00:21:54,175 --> 00:21:57,542
The thing I don't understand
about the suicide person...

548
00:21:57,575 --> 00:22:00,675
is the people that try
and commit suicide

549
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:01,287
for some reason, they don't die,
and then that's it.

550
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:03,708
for some reason, they don't die,
and then that's it.

551
00:22:03,742 --> 00:22:05,675
They stop trying.

552
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,008
Why?

553
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:09,175
Why don't they just keep trying?
What has changed?

554
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,242
Is their life any better now?

555
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:14,742
No. In fact, it's worse,
because now they've found out...

556
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:18,408
here's one more thing
you stink at.

557
00:22:18,442 --> 00:22:21,408
That's why these people don't
succeed at life to begin with.

558
00:22:21,442 --> 00:22:23,908
Because they give up too easy.
I say pills don't work,

559
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,842
try a rope.

560
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,642
Car won't start in the garage?
Get a tune-up.

561
00:22:28,675 --> 00:22:31,287
You know what I mean?

562
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:31,375
You know what I mean?

563
00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:33,175
There's nothing more rewarding

564
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:36,642
than reaching a goal
you've set for yourself.

565
00:22:36,675 --> 00:22:37,708
