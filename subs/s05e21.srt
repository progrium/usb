00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,200
Oh.

177
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:49,733
Oh!
Lobster.

178
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
BEN:
This ointment should do it.

179
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:59,400
How are you
feeling, Adam?

180
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:00,866
Elaine!

181
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,100
This is our pediatrician,
Ben Pfeffer.

182
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,633
Hi.

183
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,200
Look at him,
Elaine.

184
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:11,900
How gorgeous is he,
I ask you?

185
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:12,960
How gorgeous?

186
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,833
How gorgeous?

187
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,400
Pretty gorgeous.

188
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:17,566
Elaine, do you
have kids?

189
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,000
Me? Oh, no,
but I'd love to have a baby.

190
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:22,500
I mean, I can't wait
to have a baby.

191
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:24,733
I'm just dying
to have a baby.

192
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:27,066
A beautiful woman
like you should.

193
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,700
You're quite
breathtaking.

194
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,200
Breathtaking?

195
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:35,333
I'm breathtaking?

196
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:37,500
And he's
very particular.

197
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:40,066
Ben, you're staying
over tonight, right?

198
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,400
Uh...sure.

199
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:45,400
Uh--

200
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:46,900
I, uh...

201
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm gonna go pick up
Rachel at the station.

202
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah. See ya.

203
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:51,333
Okay.

204
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:52,366
[WHISTLES]

205
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,500
Oh, just
look at him.

206
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,866
Yeah, he really
is breathtaking.

207
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,333
The train
was so crowded,

208
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:08,333
I had a seat
facing the wrong way.

209
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:11,000
I like that.
It's like going back in time.

210
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,960
Hey, Rachel.

211
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:12,966
Hey, Rachel.

212
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,366
Hi. I'm gonna go in
and get changed.

213
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Okay.

214
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,000
What kind of greeting
was that?

215
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:23,333
She's got greeting
problems.

216
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:25,300
Yeah.

217
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,333
Boy, I love these
Hampton tomatoes.

218
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:29,466
You can eat them
like apples.

219
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,466
The tomato never really
took off as a hand fruit.

220
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,300
Well, the tomato's
an anomaly,

221
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,400
so successful
with the ketchup and the sauce,

222
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,833
but you can't
find a good one.

223
00:08:37,866 --> 00:08:39,500
Hey, hey, hey!

224
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,000
Look at what I got!

225
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,233
Whoa!

226
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:42,960
Yeah!

227
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,233
Yeah!

228
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:44,400
Wow!

229
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:46,066
The K-Man!

230
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,466
You got lobster
for everybody?

231
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,733
Yeah,
and they're fresh!

232
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:50,566
Right out
of the ocean!

233
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,466
This is fantastic!
Man, what a weekend!

234
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,233
Swimming,
lobster for dinner.

235
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:57,133
I know. It's great.

236
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,366
I saw Jane topless.

237
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:12,960
You saw who what?

238
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,733
You saw who what?

239
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:16,100
Yeah, I saw Jane topless.
Well, we all saw her.

240
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,866
All right.

241
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,733
You saw Jane
topless?

242
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:26,200
Well, when you went
for the tomatoes,

243
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,366
she lied out
topless.

244
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,133
You mean face-down
on her chest.

245
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,833
No.

246
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,233
Face-up
on her back?

247
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:37,233
Yeah.

248
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:38,733
Well, why'd she
do that?

249
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:41,900
Well, I guess
she was hot.

250
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:42,960
You mean she just
lay there topless?

251
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,900
You mean she just
lay there topless?

252
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:45,533
No. She got up.
She walked around.

253
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:46,566
Yeah.

254
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,066
Walked around?

255
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,400
And you looked?

256
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:52,700
Of course! She's got
a great body, buddy.

257
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:55,066
I'm gonna go upstairs.
I'll be right back.

258
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,066
I can't believe
that you saw her before me!

259
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,500
Think of me
as a doctor.

260
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:05,400
Well, how good a look
did you get?

261
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:07,033
Well, what do you mean?

262
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:08,533
Well...

263
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,700
If she was a criminal
and you had to describe her

264
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:12,960
to a police sketch artist.

265
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,366
to a police sketch artist.

266
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,733
They'd pick her up
in about ten minutes.

267
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,400
Great. Great.

268
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:21,666
So any time you want,

269
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,233
you can just
visualize her naked.

270
00:10:23,266 --> 00:10:25,866
I guess
that's true.

271
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,066
Stop it. Stop it.

272
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,033
This is not fair!
It's not fair.

273
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:31,866
I don't like
this situation, not one bit.

274
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,400
What do you want?
You wanna see Rachel naked?

275
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,066
Yes! Yes!

276
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,233
Yeah, right.

277
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:40,200
The punishment
should fit the crime.

278
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:42,800
You can see me naked.
I can offer ya that.

279
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:42,960
It's like
I'm Neil Armstrong.

280
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,000
It's like
I'm Neil Armstrong.

281
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,833
I turn around
for a sip of Tang,

282
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:50,033
and you jump out first!

283
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,800
Nobody ever called me
"breathtaking" before.

284
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,833
I've never been called
"breathtaking" either.

285
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:01,300
I mean, if he thinks that
that baby is breathtaking,

286
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,466
then who's <i>not</i> breathtaking?

287
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Maybe
he just said it

288
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,166
because the mother
was in the room.

289
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,633
Yeah. Right.
That's a possibility.

290
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,133
I have to find out.

291
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,300
How you gonna
do that?

292
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,866
I can be very clever.

293
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:12,960
I'm gonna take a swim.

294
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,200
I'm gonna take a swim.

295
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:16,300
Oh, me too.
I'll meet you down there.

296
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,833
Oh. Don't go in.

297
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:19,133
Rachel's getting
undressed.

298
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,566
Oh, okay.

299
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,233
Hey!

300
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,666
Oh, sorry.

301
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,833
Don't you knock?

302
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:29,733
I'm sorry. Uh...

303
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:31,166
It's not like
I'll see something

304
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,966
I've never seen before.
You might have.

305
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,700
I didn't.
You won't.

306
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:37,833
What do you want
anyway, George?

307
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:38,900
Yes, George.

308
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:41,566
I'm kind of
wondering myself.

309
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,960
What is it
that you want?

310
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,666
What is it
that you want?

311
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,233
No, I was just wondering
if you guys, uh...

312
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:48,633
had any gum.

313
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,233
Oh!

314
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,733
So you were swimming
in the pool,

315
00:11:52,766 --> 00:11:55,800
and you wanted
some gum.

316
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,666
Yes. Because
the water was cold,

317
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,366
and the, uh, chewing
warms me up.

318
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,733
We don't have any gum.

319
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,866
Okay.

320
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,500
Thanks anyway.

321
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,366
Strange man.

322
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:12,960
Wait till you get
to know him.

323
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,666
Wait till you get
to know him.

324
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,866
So where is
this baby anyway?

325
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,533
Oh. Check it out.

326
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:20,200
I guarantee
you've never seen anything

327
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:21,300
quite so objectionable.

328
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,566
[LAUGHS]

329
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,166
It's down the hall,
third door on your left.

330
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,533
Aah! Oh, my God!

331
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:37,133
I'm sorry.
I thought this was the baby's room.

332
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,233
[CHUCKLING]
I'm really sorry.

333
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,733
I was in the pool!

334
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,700
I was in the pool!

335
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,000
[♪]

336
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:56,366
GEORGE:
Did she do it on purpose?

337
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,533
It was my fault.

338
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:59,400
I told her
the wrong door.

339
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:01,166
I was supposed to see her.

340
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,566
She wasn't supposed to see me.

341
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,166
Well, so what?

342
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,400
Well, ordinarily
I wouldn't mind.

343
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:08,833
But...

344
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:10,233
But what?

345
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:15,033
Well, I just got back
from swimming in the pool,

346
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:17,066
and the water was cold.

347
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,733
Oh.

348
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:21,000
You mean shrinkage.

349
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,266
Yes.

350
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:25,800
Significant shrinkage.

351
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,633
So you feel
you were shortchanged.

352
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,133
Yes.

353
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,533
I mean, if she
thinks that's me,

354
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:32,500
she's under a complete
misapprehension.

355
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:34,333

00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,233
What happened?

536
00:19:58,266 --> 00:20:01,400
Well, I almost
tried the lobster.

537
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:02,633
But Kramer stopped me.

538
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,400
Well, I knew
you'd regret it

539
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:06,666
for the rest
of your life.

540
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,666
I would have.

541
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,300
Hey,
look at this guy.

542
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,633
A little
breakfast?

543
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,633
Yeah.

544
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,966
And you eat eggs,
don't you?

545
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,966
Yes, I do.

546
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,066
All right.

547
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,566
Thank you.

548
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,233
These are delicious.

549
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:21,066
Where did you learn
to make eggs like this?

550
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,397
These are so good.

551
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:22,533
These are so good.

552
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:24,700
Aw. Enjoying them?

553
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:25,700
Mm-hm.

554
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:27,066
Oh, good.

555
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:31,633
You know, you might
wanna try eating it

556
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,666
with one of these.

557
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:37,066
There's lobster
in these eggs?

558
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,233
Not that much.
They shrink in the water.

559
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:46,133
Well, I guess I gotta go too.

560
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,233
Well, this has turned out

561
00:20:48,266 --> 00:20:50,400
to be one hell of a weekend.

Excuse me.

00:20:52,397 --> 00:20:52,766
Excuse me.

565
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,233
I'm sorry
to bother you,

566
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:59,733
but we're trying
to track down a lobster poacher

567
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:01,533
that cleaned out
one of the traps.

568
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:02,866
Wonder what's
going on.

569
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,033
Ah, I guess I should
go up and apologize.

570
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:08,000
There he is,
officer.

00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,566
Yeah.

00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:14,233
Don't you ever knock?

574
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,333
Why did Rachel
have to drive back

575
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:19,733
with Michael and Carol?

576
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:21,700
Hey, if you saw
me naked,

577
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:22,397
I wouldn't wanna ride
with you either.

578
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:24,200
I wouldn't wanna ride
with you either.

579
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:26,500
I still can't believe
Michael finked on Kramer.

580
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:29,900
How is he gonna
pay off a $1000 fine?

581
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:32,366
They got some
sort of program.

00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:37,733
What?

583
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,300
Hey, there's
a tomato stand.

584
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,033
Let's stop.
I can get some more.

Hey, isn't that
Michael's car?

586
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:50,800
There's Rachel.

Where?

588
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,666
Look at the work people will do
to get to the ocean.

589
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,633
They'll fight the traffic
and the heat

590
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,500
and the parking
and the hot sand,

591
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:12,000
trying to get
through the waves,

592
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:13,533
and the ironic thing is,

593
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:17,300
the ocean doesn't even
really want us in there.

594
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,666
That's what's surfing is.

595
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,133
Surfing is the ocean
throwing us out of itself.

596
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,733
You see?

597
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:25,900
We keep trying to paddle in.

598
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:28,400
And the ocean is saying,
"No, you don't."

599
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:30,566
The ocean is like a nightclub,

600
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,822
and the waves are bouncers
tossing us out.

601
00:22:32,822 --> 00:22:33,000
and the waves are bouncers
tossing us out.

602
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:35,000
The undertow's like
the really mean bouncer.

603
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,333
Instead of throwing you out,

604
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:38,500
they take you in back
and rough you up a little bit.
