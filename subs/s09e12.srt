Hey, Silvio.

Just out for a little stroll
in my favorite fur coat.

532
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,037
That is your coat?

533
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,370
It sure is.

534
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:36,037
Kramer says you need it

535
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,403
because you're an entertainer

536
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,237
and you're desperate
for attention.

537
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,303
That's true.

538
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:40,647
Jerry, you forgot
your purse.

your purse.

Oh, thanks.

you're not fancy!

Jerry,

00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,737
where'd you get it?
That's his coat.

556
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,170
No, it's not.
It's mine.

557

I'm a fancy boy.

558
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,837
That's not your coat.

559

If that is not his coat,
whose coat is it?

It's Joe Mayo's coat.
