00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:02,966
So, I move into the center lane.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Now, I get ahead of this woman
who felt, for some reason,

3
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:07,666
I guess, that she thought
that I'd cut her off.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,633
So she pulls up
alongside of me,

5
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:14,133
gives me...the finger.

6
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:15,733
It seems like

7
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,466
such an arbitrary,
ridiculous thing

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,066
to just pick a finger,
and you show it to the person.

9
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,700
It's a finger.
What does it mean?

10
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:30,000
Someone shows me
one of their fingers,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,200
Someone shows me
one of their fingers,

12
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:32,200
and I'm supposed to feel bad.

13
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:34,700
Is that the way
it's supposed to work?

14
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:37,633
I mean...you could just
give someone the toe, really,

15
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,133
couldn't you?

16
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,333
I would feel worse
if I got the toe

17
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:42,866
than if I got the finger,

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,366
because it's not easy
to give someone the toe.

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,700
You got to get the shoe off,
the sock off,

20
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:50,300
and drive, get it up in the...

21
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,000
Look at that toe, buddy.

22
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:55,166
I mean, that's really insulting,
to get the toe, isn't it?

Uh, yeah.

The hot water takes
a little while to come on,

Twice what you're paying here,
but it's a great building.

104
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,700
It's two bedrooms.

105
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:42,700
Two bedrooms?

take a look at it.

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,900

Ah.

You have no hot water,

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,966
you can't have
soft cheese.

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,466
And let's not forget
the radiator.

121

The steam has been on here
for 10 years.

can turn this off.

take a look at this place.

it's a step up.

Well, for me,
it's a step up.

00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,666
It's like moving from

132
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,466
Do you want to see
the place or not?

the spatula right back.

00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,333
So did you bring the lease?

361
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,200
Well, all right.

362
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:33,733
Gee, three years.

363
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:36,000
That kind of seems
like a long time.

364
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:37,333
Oh, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry,

365
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:38,561
Listen, if you are
feeling uncomfortable

366
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:39,800
Listen, if you are
feeling uncomfortable

367
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,133
about this at all,
at all,

368
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,233
do not feel like
you have to take it.

369
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:45,533
Why?

370
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:48,133
If you're having
second thoughts,

371
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,800
if you didn't want it,

372
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,966
don't worry about it,

373
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,200
because, uh, you know, I--

374
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,066
I could take it, you know?

375
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,366
You could take it?

376
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,366
You want it?

377
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,333
No, I don't want it.

378
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:02,966
I want it if you don't want it.

379
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,166
So you...do want it.

380
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,300
No, I want it
if you don't want it.

381
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,561
You just said you wanted it.

382
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:09,300
You just said you wanted it.

383
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,466
No, I'm saying
if a situation arose

384
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,066
in which you didn't want it,

385
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,066
I might take it.

386
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,233
So take it.

387
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:17,233
How can I take it?

388
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:18,233
How can I take it?

389
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:19,333
It's your apartment.

390
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:21,333
How can I want it now
if you want it?

391
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:24,166
Excuse me. I don't mean
to cause any trouble here,

392
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,133
but, George, if you take it,

393
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,500
can I take your place?

394
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,333
Yes, but I am not taking it.

395
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,966
I am not taking it.

396
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,866
Well, one of you better
damn well take it.

397
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,466
Well, what do you want
to do here?

398
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,561
I don't know.

399
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:38,666
I don't know.

400
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,633
Do you want to flip a coin?

401
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,700
Who flips?

402
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,166
You flip, I'll call.

403
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,300
Okay. Fine.

404
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,566
All right. All right.

405
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,633
This is
the official flip.

406
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,633
All right.

407
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,966
No crying, no guilt.

408
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,466
Winner takes all, and that's it.
Agreed?

409
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,466
I'm good.

410
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,833
I don't know
who to root for.

411
00:14:57,866 --> 00:14:59,466
George's place
has carpeting.

412
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Shh, shh.

413
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,500
All right.

414
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,900
Now, you call it
in the air.

415
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:04,300
No catching.
No, no.

416
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,300
All right, flip it.

417
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,466
Heads!

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,833

420
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:09,633
Tails.

421
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,466
No, it hit the table.
It hit the table.

422
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,566
So what?

423
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,800
Interference.
You can't count that.

424
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,566
Come on.
Are you crazy?

425
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,666
The coin cannot
touch anything.

426
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,700
It affects it.

427
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:20,500
You didn't call
"no interference."

428
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:21,700
You don't have
to call that.

429
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:22,700
That's a rule!

430
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:23,900
I don't believe this.

431
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:25,666
Oh! Oh! All right. Fine, Jerry.

432
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,133
You win. Take it.
Just take it.

433
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,700
I don't want
to win it like this.

434
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:33,233
Elaine,
what do you think?

435
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,466
I better not.

436
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,100
Jesus.

437
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,133
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'll choose you for it.

438
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,166
Straight choose, three takes it.

439
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,000
No disputes. That's it.
You got to win three.

440
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:48,233
Okay.

441
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:55,366
Okay. I'll choose you.

442
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:58,200
What do you want?

443
00:15:58,233 --> 00:15:59,300
Odds.

444
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,866
I want evens.

445
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,233
Good.

446
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:04,733
You got odds.

447
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:05,733
You got evens.

448
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:06,733
Right.

449
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,561
Ready.

450
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:08,866
Ready.

451
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,533
For the apartment.

452
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:11,666
BOTH: Once, twice,
three, shoot!

453
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,666
Mine.

454
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,900
BOTH: Once, twice,
three, shoot!

455
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:14,900
Mine!

456
00:16:20,933 --> 00:16:22,866
BOTH: Once, twice,
three, shoot!

457
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,866
Mine!

458
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,866
BOTH: Once, twice, three,

459
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,833
Shoot!
Shoot!

460
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:33,733
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

461
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:35,133
Thanks.

462
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,566
I'm just gonna...wash.

GEORGE [YELLING]:
Why did I put out two? Why did I put out two?

464
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,533
[BANGING DOOR]

465
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:45,533
Jerry?

466
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:46,866
I think I'm onto something.

467
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,233
I think I found your stuff.

468
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:51,066
You know the Englishman
who lives down the hall?

469
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,533
Yeah.

470
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:54,666
The last couple of days,
he's been acting very strange.

471
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,733
I think he's avoiding me.

472
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:56,900
Hard to imagine.

473
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,633
Yeah, and get this--

474
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,233
I just got off the elevator
with him,

475
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:01,833
and I tested him.
I tested him.

476
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:03,633
Like I-- This is what
I said to him,

477
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,400
like I was like this, I went,

478
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:08,561
"Oh, by the way, I know
about the stuff."

479
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:08,966
"Oh, by the way, I know
about the stuff."

480
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,900
You know, very casual...
Right.

481
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:12,500
so he's gonna take me
into his confidence.

482
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:13,500
So, what did he say?

483
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,033
"What stuff?"

484
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,566
Oh.

485
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,066
Case closed.

486
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,233
Oh, no, no.
You don't understand.

487
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:21,400
You see, he swallowed.

488
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,200
See, the guy, he swallowed.

489
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:26,566
Oh, he was nervous
about something.

490
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,366
Now, I'm gonna go over there.

491
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,066
I'm gonna borrow some tea.

492
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,066
You know, if I don't get back
in five minutes,

493
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,066
maybe you better call
the police.

494
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,133
Okay.

495
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,066
Starting...now!

496
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,561
Yeah!

497
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:39,066
Yeah!

498
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:44,300
One of the problems in life
is that when you're a kid,

499
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,900
you have a certain way
of working out disagreements...

500
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,400
and those laws do not work
in the adult world.

501
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:53,166
One of the main ways
that kids resolve any dispute

502
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,566
is by calling it.

503
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,366
One of them'll say,
"I got the front seat."

504
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,333
"I wanted the front seat."
"I called it."

505
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,800
And the other kid knows
he's got nothing to say.

506
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,533
"He called it. What can I do?"

507
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:07,066
If there was a kid court of law,
it holds up.

508
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,561
"Your Honor, my client did ask
for the front seat."

509
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:11,666
"Your Honor, my client did ask
for the front seat."

510
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,233
And the judge would go,
"Did he call it?"

511
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:16,400
"Well, no, he didn't call it--"

512
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:18,166
Bang. "He has to call it.

513
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,833
Case closed.
Objection overruled."

514
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,366
I love the mirror
in that bathroom.

515
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,833
I don't know what
in the hell it is.

516
00:18:26,866 --> 00:18:28,833
I look terrific
in that mirror.

517
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:31,333
I don't know if it's the tile
or the lighting.

518
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:34,333
I feel like Robert Wagner
in there.

519
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:36,766
It's a good mirror.

520
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:40,033
So, what are you getting?

521
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:41,533
I don't know. What can you eat?

522
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:43,800
You can't have anything anymore.

523
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,000
Look at this. Look at this.

524
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:46,633
Eggs, out.

525
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,966
Coffee, out.

526
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,666
French fries, out.

527
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,666
B.L.T., out.

528
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,466
I go to visit
my grandparents.

529
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
They're eating
big brisket sandwiches.

530
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,533
I'm sitting there with a carrot.

531
00:18:57,566 --> 00:18:58,900
They're closing in on 100.

532
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:01,166
I'm saying to them,
"How can you eat that stuff?"

533
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:08,561
I'm so sick about
losing that choose.

534
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:08,633
I'm so sick about
losing that choose.

535
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,066
You don't know. I--

536
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,566
All right. Forget it.
Forget it.

537
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,733
I'm not taking the place.

538
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:14,733
What?

539
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:16,666
How can I live there?
Why not?

540
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,300
Look at you. You're
still thinking about it.

541
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,000
I'll never feel comfortable.
Oh, please. Get outta here.

542
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:22,400
How can I ever
have you over?

543
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:24,033
You'll sit there moping.

544
00:19:24,066 --> 00:19:25,066
I won't mope.

545
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,800
You're
already moping.

546
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,233
Would you take the place?

547
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:30,733
No. Impossible.
It's your apartment.

548
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:32,066
You found the place.

549
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,533
You won the choose.

550
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:35,233
All right. Forget it.

551
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:36,533
It's over.
I'm not moving.

552
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,533
Well, me neither.

553
00:19:38,566 --> 00:19:40,800
Definitely?
Definitely.

554
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,733
All right.
Then just get rid of it.

555
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,700
You won't have any problem.

556
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:45,900
No, it's not a problem.

557
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:47,300
I can get rid
of the apartment

558
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,633
this afternoon.

559
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,233
What apartment?

560
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:51,900
Oh, it's a great place.

561
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:53,633
It's a two-bedroom, West 83rd,

562
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,233
about a half block
from the park.

563
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:57,766
What's the rent?

564
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:08,561
I hate housewarmings.

565
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:09,300
I hate housewarmings.

566
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,966
I don't know
what we're doing here.

567
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,400
This is ridiculous.

568
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:14,566
She wanted to thank us
for the apartment.

569
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:19,233
I can't believe
I lost the deposit

570
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:21,400
on that U-Haul,

571
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:24,033
and I threw out my couch.

572
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,300
If only the coin
hadn't hit the table.

573
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,533
The table is interference.
You know it.

574
00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:33,000
It is not.
It is too.

575
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:37,000
My roommate starts
rehearsal tonight on <i>Carousel.</i>

576
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,561
Hi.

577
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:39,533
Hi.

578
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:40,566
Oh, hi, Carol.

579
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,733
I just wanted
to introduce you

580
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:42,733
to my husband.

581
00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:43,733
This is Larry.

582
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:47,566
This is George,
Elaine and Jerry.

583
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,566
These are the guys
who got us the apartment.

584
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,700
You don't know
how grateful I am.

585
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:55,000
If there's anything
I can ever do to repay you--

586
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:57,033
I mean, we're just
so thrilled with this place.

587
00:20:57,066 --> 00:20:58,166
It's a dream.

588
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,566
LARRY: I'm running
in the park now.

589
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,633
I've lost weight.

590
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,500
We're barbecuing
every night,

591
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:04,266
and the rent
is unbelievable.

592
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:08,561
We're really glad
for you.

593
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:11,233
We're really glad
for you.

594
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:13,233
Couldn't be happier.

595
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:14,233
It's wonderful.

596
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,966
Oh, Diane.

597
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,966
Diane, come here.

598
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,800
This is my new
next-door neighbor, Diane.

599
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:21,900
Hi.

600
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:24,800
These are the guys
who turned this place down.

601
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,800
Can you believe it?

602
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,866
Diane gave me
the greatest back rub today.

603
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,033
She's a masseuse.

604
00:21:33,766 --> 00:21:36,833
How could you guys
have turned this place down?

605
00:21:36,866 --> 00:21:38,400
It's such
a great location,

606
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:38,561
and it's so close
to the park.

607
00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:41,166
and it's so close
to the park.

608
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,800
Yeah, we're aware
of the proximity to the park.

609
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,233
It's--

610
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:49,833
Well, it was nice
to meet you.

611
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:51,066
Nice to meet you.

612
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,600
[SIGHS]

613
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,666
[SIGHS]

614
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,066
How late are
the stores open?

615
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,066
I'm thinking of maybe
buying a new TV

616
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,400
and smashing it
over my head.

617
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:12,066
So I get a call from Gilmore
this morning, and get this--

618
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,400
They're restructuring
the organization in Atlanta,

619
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,566
and I gotta be there
on the first of the month.

620
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,400
Really? What are you gonna do
about the apartment?

621
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:19,733
Well, what can I do?
I'll give it up.

622
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:22,033
[IN UNISON]
What's the rent?

623
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:30,700
